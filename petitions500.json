I know everyone\u2019s still reeling from the death of Brandon Bernard, however there\u2019s another issue! Cory Johnson is scheduled to be killed 6 days before Biden is inaugurated. Johnson was 1/3 crack cocaine dealers who was convicted in 1992, for a string of murders that claimed 10 lives in a 45-day period. Prosecutor\u2019s have stated that he killed 7 people, in an attempt to expand gang-territory in Richmond, Virginia. HOWEVER Johnson is intellectually disabled, and after a 2002 Virginia case, the Supreme Court ruled it unlawful to execute a person who is of \u201csuch low intelligence that they can\u2019t function in society\u201d. Also, NO jury or court has listened to the evidence that his lawyers have presented to decide whether or not Johnson has an intellectual disability. Allowing Cory Johnson\u2019s execution to go forward will be a GRAVE INJUSTICE.\nJohnson suffered a HORRIBLE, childhood, filled with mental, physical, and emotional abuse, along with neglect (which are all risk factors for intellectual disabilities). At 13 he was abandoned by his drug-addict mother to a residential facility for children with intellectual &amp; emotional impairments, because he could not learn, and she was not able to cope his limitations. He transferred from numerous schools, and homes until 18 where we was released from a similar facility, with zero life skills, no life structure/support, and overall a little to no chance at succeeding at life. There has been any other federal death penalty prisoner who has NEVER had a single evidentiary hearing in which they could present their intellectual disability evidence. Johnson\u2019s execution should not proceed in the absence of fair &amp; thorough opportunity to present his evidence. Three experts in intellectual disability have also concluded that there is an OVERWHELMING amount of evidence to PROVE that Johnson IS intellectually disabled. Also, Johnson\u2019s co-defendant Vernon Thomas, who was convicted of the same violent acts as Johnson (including 4 murders), was spared the death penalty because of his own intellectual disability.Mind y\u2019all, there has NOT been a lame duck execution in the transition period since 1888-1889. Now under the Trump Administration, there will be 3+.\nI believe that Cory Johnson deserves to face punishment for what he\u2019s done. HOWEVER I do NOT support him being put to death. Johnson has shown to suffer from intellectual disability, and he deserves the right for a jury to hear so.

Richard Reiger let it be known to a neighbor that he had been sleeping in the same bed as Tayvion and then he notified me about it and that is when I asked my son about what happened about his experiences at these sleepovers.\nTayvion only told me so much but I reported it to the police in late September and he had his forensic interview October 21st. I do not wish to share explicit details but they were not limited to Reiger removing all of his clothing before climbing into the bed and Reiger putting his hands on my son. I later took Tayvion in for a forensic interview in which Tayvion gave more detailed information to the investigators so they know more about the actual assault than myself at this point.\nTayvion has changed drastically and is now a depressed little boy that is now having panic attacks multiple times a week and is always angry.

We demand that the shelter at the SDCC remain open until the decision to close is made in the best interest of ALL San Diegans.&nbsp;\nIn April (2020), the city of San Diego took a historic step in addressing its long-standing homelessness crisis. Named Operation Shelter to Home, the city of San Diego converted two of the city\u2019s major events centers, the San Diego Convention Center (SDCC) and the Golden Hall, into shelters for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. There are now plans in place to close down the shelter (currently covering 1200+ individuals) at the SDCC on December 31st, 2020. We, the Mustard Seed Project, along with our fellow community members and concerned San Diegans, believe that this decision was not made in the best interest of our community. This shelter at the SDCC has proven to be extraordinarily successful in the ways it has supported our city and the people who make it America\u2019s Finest City.&nbsp;\nThe initial reason SDCC was explicitly chosen to be used as a shelter is due to its large occupant capacity and physical space for social distancing. Most other shelters in San Diego are currently operating at half capacity, with hardly enough space to social distance (Shelter beds at Newton Ave. are only 3 feet apart). Our community was able to come together and collaborate with one another to provide the safest streamlined services to support our unsheltered community. With help from Father Joe\u2019s Village, The Alpha Project, and Veteran\u2019s Village of San Diego, the SDCC was able to provide not only basic needs like food, showers, bathrooms, laundry services, and sanitary living spaces but able to go above and beyond in its mental and behavioral health services as well as daily health screenings. Furthermore, the coordination of numerous homeless services in a single location has also proved to be immensely successful. Since its inception in April, we have seen a collaborative effort to centralize services like SSI, State ID, and many others. This consolidation of resources has more than proven its effectiveness, resulting in over 700 housing vouchers, 332 permanent supportive housing units created, and numerous other successes.\nIn light of the pandemic, widespread economic crisis, the winter season, and the need for continued progress, we make the following demands:\n\nKeep the Operation Shelter to Home shelter open at the San Diego Convention Center until San Diego is able to reach the Yellow Tier for a minimum of 5 weeks. It is unconscionable to close Operation Shelter to Home at the Convention Center while the fatal threat of COVID-19 is only increasing.\nIncrease funding for social workers, permanent supportive housing, and expanding access to sanitation.

Sri Lanka committed the 21st century\u2019s most heinous acts of genocide in the final phase of the war in 2008 and 2009.&nbsp;\nWe call upon the United Nations and its Member States to:\n1. Firmly and unequivocally pass a time-bound resolution at the 46th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council mandating an international, impartial and independent investigation into the conduct of the Sri Lankan state and its occupying military during the final phase of the war, and into the ongoing acts of genocide and human rights violations\n2. Pass a resolution at the UN Security Council and/or General Assembly that is similar to the above resolution but additionally refers Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court (ICC)&nbsp;\n3. Act swiftly to severely punish those found responsible for acts of genocide or other abuses, and to instate a protection mechanism that will prevent a recurrence of genocide.\nWe make this request noting that:\n1. The Sri Lankan state and its security forces stand accused of committing genocide against Eelam Tamils, and also of committing crimes against humanity, war crimes and numerous human rights violations against Eelam Tamils (see here);\n2. Some of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst atrocities were committed in 2009, when tens of thousands of Eelam Tamil civilians were massacred in a premeditated genocide with Sri Lanka deliberately understating the Tamil civilian population in the war zone (claiming 70,000, not 429,000, lived there) before cutting off food and medicine, and then obliterating the small patch where these hundreds of thousands of civilians had sought refuge, although the Sri Lankan government admitted that only a few hundred LTTE fighters lived there (see here);\n3. 146,679 Eelam Tamil civilians are as yet unaccounted for, after the last phase of the war, many having gone missing after being seized by Sri Lankan security forces (see here&nbsp;or here);\n4. Nearly 12 years have passed since the above acts of genocide during which time no tangible progress has been made towards an independent investigation into the Sri Lankan security forces\u2019 conduct, and the passage of time has assisted Sri Lanka to cover up its atrocities by destroying the evidence;&nbsp;\n5. In the last 12 years, Sri Lankan security forces have enjoyed total impunity and the Sri Lankan state has evaded accountability, setting a dangerous precedent for future acts of genocide not only in Sri Lanka but also, elsewhere;\n6. Acts of genocide continue to the present day with Eelam Tamils being targeted for abuses such as rape, destructive conditions of life (especially amongst the internally displaced), ethnocide and systematic ethnic cleansing of Tamils from their lands;&nbsp;\n7. The Nazi-type motivation for genocide (ideology that Sinhala people are a \u2018chosen people\u2019 and therefore superior, and Sri Lanka is their \u2018promised land\u2019 and Eelam Tamils a threat), and a supportive state apparatus, could trigger further acts of genocide against Eelam Tamils at any time;&nbsp;\n8. Any internal investigation of Sri Lanka\u2019s conduct would be inherently compromised, as it would be tantamount to a crime\u2019s perpetrator adjudicating on their own innocence;\n9. There can be no lasting peace or stability in the region&nbsp;without accountability and redress for the aforementioned international crimes against Eelam Tamil civilians.\nThis petition has been put forth and spearheaded by the next generation of the Tamil diaspora.

He acted like he hadn\u2019t been giving a good scratch\u2019n in a very very long time. His (log) chain was attached to an old gate put up by my grandfather a long time ago, And he had about 10ft of space to roam.

(Keep in mind it was 38F\u00b0 And raining the first time I saw Boss. He had no water in his water bowl and no food in his food bowl. The only food available to him was a bag of (damp) dry dog food inside the trailer.

Josh Hawley should be immediately EXPELLED from the U.S. Senate.&nbsp; He has violated his oath, stoked a violent mob of domestic terrorists and attempted to tear down our democracy.&nbsp; Hawley was soliciting campaign funds while our nation's Capitol was under attack and people were dying.&nbsp; He is a despicable, self-serving, deplorable, insurrectionist.\n2) As reported in the KC Star, Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley became the first senator to say he\u2019ll object to the certification of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to accept the results of the presidential election.\nHawley cited unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and accused the state of Pennsylvania of failing to adhere to its election laws by extending the deadline for mail-in ballots, an argument that has repeatedly been rejected by federal courts.&nbsp; He held up the Electoral College Vote Certification process twice with his unfounded conspiracy theories, offering zero evidence to support his claims.\n3) Josh Hawley lied when he tweeted that a \"candle-light vigil for democracy\" at his home in Virginia as \"Antifa scumbags came to our place in DC and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can\u2019t travel. They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door.\"&nbsp; Video evidence shows that nothing of the sort happened.&nbsp; The dozen or so protestors chanted, sang and prayed outside his home, but exhibited no violence, threats or vandalism of any sort.\n4) Sen. Josh Hawley doesn't even live in Missouri.&nbsp; A review of property records shows that the first-term Republican is no longer a Missouri homeowner and that he is registered to vote at his sister\u2019s home in Ozark, MO, while he is in-between homes in the state. He has alternately told the press he is living with his parents in Springfield, MO.\nHawley owns a $1.3 million house in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., where he spends most of his time with his wife, Erin Hawley, and their three children.\n5) Two separate MO audits found that in Hawley's short tenure as Missouri\u2019s attorney general there were many paperwork and management problems that may have cost taxpayers unnecessary amounts of money.\nTaxpayer-paid staff working in former Attorney General Josh Hawley\u2019s office met with his political consultants, perhaps more than a dozen times, in the months before he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2017.\nSeveral instances of travel related abuses noted that Hawley used a state vehicle and a driver for some trips without documenting the purpose of the trip. One cited example was that a driver told the auditor that on Dec. 16, 2017, he drove Sen. Hawley and his wife, Erin, to Kansas City for a Chiefs football game.\n6) Former U.S. Sen. John C. Danforth on Thursday, following the domestic terrorist attacks on the U.S. Capitol building, said to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: \"Supporting Josh&nbsp;and trying so hard to get him elected to the Senate was the worst mistake I ever made in my life. Yesterday was the physical culmination of the long attempt (by Hawley and others) to foment a lack of public confidence in our democratic system. It is very dangerous to America to continue pushing this idea that government doesn\u2019t work and that voting was fraudulent.\"\nJosh Hawley is seditious and self-serving. Hawley has blood on his hands for fomenting rioting at the U.S. Capitol. He is dishonest and is not upholding the oaths and ethics of his elected offices. Sen.

Every year, around 100 million animals suffer and are killed for their fur. The vast majority are kept on intensive fur farms. Animals including fox, mink, raccoon dogs and chinchillas are kept for their entire lives in tiny wire cages, before being killed and skinned for so-called fashion.\nNot only do these battery cage systems cause immense animal suffering, they are also now proven to present a serious public-health risk. The cramped conditions, poor hygiene, stress, injuries and disease, minimal veterinary care, and lack of genetic diversity all mean that fur farms create ideal conditions for viruses to be transmitted, and for viruses to mutate creating new strains.\nHundreds of mink farms in countries including the Netherlands, USA, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, Greece, Spain and Lithuania have been found to have animals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. On farms in Denmark, the virus has already mutated into new strains, which have in turn infected people. Disease prevention experts have expressed grave concerns, including the European Centre for Disease Control who stated in a November report that the evolution of the virus in mink could undermine the effectiveness of future vaccines in humans. The report also found that \u201ccontinued transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms may eventually give rise to other variants of concern\u201d.\nGovernments cannot respond to this crisis simply by culling millions of animals and then allowing farmers to return to business as usual. The appalling conditions on fur farms make them a ticking time bomb for pandemic disease risk. Disease transmission experts warn that it is a matter of when, and not if, another deadly virus hits if we continue to keep animals in conditions that push them beyond the limits of their physical and psychological endurance.\nTwenty countries have already acted to ban the farming of animals for their fur because it is cruel, outdated and unnecessary. In light of new evidence that fur farms can also act as reservoirs for deadly viruses, as well as create new viruses, we call on all countries to&nbsp;ban fur farms, and we call on G20 leaders to&nbsp;publicly acknowledge that fur farming must end.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/kl/ht/APklHTkmTGrswSA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607111611"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/it-s-time-to-let-kobe-begin-his-life?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Let's Let Kobe Begin His Life", "description": "By a stroke of fate, I met Kobe from an online correspondence program with people who are currently incarcerated. I was really curious how people in prison were feeling during this time in our world. I am currently a junior studying social work, and I was really interested in learning more about criminal justice and the prison system in our country. I sent out a letter introducing myself, and hoped he would write me back. He wrote back immediately, sharing all about his past with an open heart and honest words. We started writing to each other every week, and soon for me it became less about the prison system and more about the cycle of vulnerability people of color experience in our society. His parents weren't exactly always providing support, unfortunately they had struggles of their own- the system had failed them too. He shared with me that when he was thirteen, he was passed around to his uncle because his mom could not take care of him. He had bounced around the foster system, but eventually his uncle offered to have him come stay. He was taught how to sell drugs and make money quickly. He was thirteen. My little brother is fifteen, and I could never imagine him transferring from one temporary family to the next, and then getting a lesson from the main male figure in his life how to make a living, illegally.&nbsp;\nI believe that Kobe\u2019s bunk bed in prison had his name on it since the day he was born. I believe that the systems we have in place in our society failed him by a large margin. His situation made it clear to me just how privileged I am as a white person in our country. Kobe and I talk every day for an hour. It costs me about $12-$20 per day, but talking to him is like feeling a ray of sunshine after months of clouds. Seeing his face on the tiny grainy video screen is like getting a glimpse into the bright and shiny soul that is within him. Today on our video visit, he closed his eyes and took some deep breaths. He said he was trying hard to have faith, trying to keep his strength, but he wasn\u2019t sure why \u201cthey needed to put me in here for so long.\u201d If prison is supposed to be about rehabilitation, I need to know why this man\u2019s life was taken away from ages 21 to 36. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me how somebody with so much love, care, and incredible ideas is stuck behind a fence where they have to pay outrageous prices for phone calls, work full time to be making less than $1 an hour, isn\u2019t eligible for any financial aid, and sleeps in a room with 100 other men.&nbsp;\nKobe dreams of owning a food truck. He wants it to be southern food and he already has the whole thing drawn out and the menu decided. He wants to get his business degree so he can have an advantage when he\u2019s out, as well as expand his knowledge of how to be a successful business owner. Kobe is an amazing artist. He draws this amazing detailed art on the outside of the envelopes he sends me, and recently I had the idea to turn these drawings into stickers to pay for his degree. It blew up and within 3 weeks he made enough to pay for his degree, which was full priced, because prisoners aren\u2019t eligible for any sort of financial assistance.\nHis smile could make anyone smile.\nHis smile deserves to be seen.\nHis smile and his light and his laughter and his joy deserves to be where people can hear him and see him.\nThe color of his skin gave him an unfair disadvantage in this lifetime, and the least I can do is get his story heard.\nI have people from all different countries wanting to sign a petition to set Kobe free and get his life started. I don\u2019t want him to have to wait 12 more years to start a food truck. I don\u2019t want him to have to wait 12 more years to see his mom. I don\u2019t want him to have to give away his books because he doesn\u2019t have room under his bunk bed. He gave me his all-inclusive book wishlist the other day. It included titles like, \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d \u201cHistory of African Americans,\u201d \u201cAwaken Your Third Eye,\u201d \"The Science of Everyday Life,\" \u201cHow to Start and Run a Food Truck,\u201d \u201cRumi\u2019s Little Book of Love,\u201d and countless other books that just prove how committed Kobe is to changing his life. He is committed to finding the way and the resources to becoming the best person he can be. He realized that he has options that he didn\u2019t realize he had before. He was taught the only way to make money was by doing so the wrong way. He didn\u2019t realize people would buy his art. He was never told that he was worthy or valid. He was never told that he could do anything he wanted. Nobody ever made that clear, in fact society did just the opposite. His closest circle taught him that he was unworthy: unworthy of success, unworthy of love, unworthy of happiness. He had that drummed into him since he was born, and then was expected to rise up despite the entire world relentlessly pushing him down. 12 more years trapped in prison is not the way for him to get started in his life. He is 23 years old. He is just getting his life started. He now knows what he is capable of.&nbsp;\nHow can I show our state he will contribute more to society than the majority of the American population? He plans on becoming a motivational speaker. He plans on opening a nonprofit resource center for single mothers. He has so many things he wants to do, he draws up plans for them all day long.\nAre we going to make him wait another 12 years to get started? Or will we believe in him now? I am respectfully requesting we make this man\u2019s dreams come alive by granting him clemency. He knows now that there are limitless other paths for him, and he is beyond excited to start living his life and break the relentless cycle of vulnerability.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/yn/ej/TdYnejVNCfNdtFO-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610082768"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/us-congress-remove-josh-hawley-from-office-0919156c-29d8-4fde-b793-71275efbfffc?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "They are coming for me!", "description": "Thank you to all those who have signed this petition.

He created Birdsprings Solar company, training local Navajo to create these panels, bidding on government contracts and installing them at places like Chinle Indian Health Services Hospital.&nbsp;\nWe are grateful that a new school expands the history of this great legacy into the future, but we would like to see the original buildings remain as a testament to the original plight of native children being sent to government boarding schools.

We would like to create an amazing interpretive exhibit, showing the history of Birdsprings, of government forces removal of school aged children to residential schools. The legacy of our people, the dreams of Little Singer to bring the children home, and how Little Singer found a quirky white guy that devoted his entire life to bring these children home needs to be saved for future generations.\nIn the future we will be asking for funds to actually create or move this amazing historical opportunity.&nbsp; But for now, we must just stop the irreversible destruction of an amazing future archeological historical site.\nPlease help my family and me to stop the destruction.&nbsp; We can deal with the rebuilding later.&nbsp; Thank you for listening.&nbsp; Please take care.

Whilst in police custody, Zara was asked about the work of her organisation and why she left Islam.\nZara was bailed on 29 December 2020 and told to return to the police station on 31 December.

Trump Park.&nbsp; Public record will show that Trump and his associated development company paid $2 million for this property. After being unable to develop the property, the land was donated to the State of New York which he and his firm used as a tax write-off.&nbsp; This was not a charitable gift derived out of generosity but an equitable exchange of real property for a financial incentive.\nSeveral previous proposed names have all been admirable choices but perhaps have not met the benchmark through which most public lands have been rededicated in our State, to honor individuals rather than perhaps individuals who have donated land. The naming of a park should be that of a historic New Yorker who has made an outstanding contribution to the history and development of our state and one who evokes the values of patriotism, inclusiveness and equity under the law.&nbsp; There are few individuals who embodied the spirit and diversity of New York like Sojourner Truth. It seems only fitting that a park stripped of the name of a man who incited insurrection should be replaced with that of a woman who fought against and helped defeat insurrectionists.&nbsp;\nSojourner Truth was born into slavery as Isabella Baumfree near Kingston, NY in 1797.&nbsp; She was sold at least twice during her early life and was not freed until mandated under State Law in 1827.&nbsp; Truth successfully sued for the return and freedom of her son from the State of Alabama in 1828.&nbsp; As a free person she became active both within her church as well as the abolition and suffrage movements.&nbsp; She gained national notoriety for her speech \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d and would actively participate in the causes of emancipation, enfranchisement and equal protection under the law.&nbsp; Her ardent activism to help her neighbors and fellow Americans was tirelessly carried out all the while supporting and raising a family on her own.&nbsp; Truth passed away at Battle Creek, Michigan in 1883.&nbsp; Shortly after her death Frederick Douglass said she was \u201cVenerable for age, distinguished for insight into human nature, remarkable for independence and courageous self-assertion, devoted to the welfare of her race, she has been for the last forty years an object of respect and admiration to social reformers everywhere.\"", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/eu/fv/EbeufVXNUSCzioD-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610420884"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/utah-state-senate-make-transporting-dogs-unsecured-on-truck-beds-illegal-in-the-state-of-utah?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Make transporting dogs unsecured on truck beds illegal in the state of Utah", "description": "On the afternoon of July 16th myself, husband, and 4 year old daughter were driving north on 1-15 in Ogden, Utah when we witnessed my greatest fear, a dog falling from the bed of a pick up truck going roughly 80 MPH.

Though seventeen states and the District of Columbia have banned pound seizure, Kentucky still allows municipalities and individual shelters to decide whether or not they will release animals to labs.&nbsp;\nAside from subjecting animals to unspeakably inhumane conditions, the practice of pound seizure challenges the integrity of shelters and loses the trust of those surrendering animals. Rather than risk their pet being surrendered to a research facility, many people abandon their pets, leading those animals to face starvation and other threats to their survival.&nbsp;\nIn addition to promoting increased rates of animal abandonment, pound seizure decreases shelters' commitment to securing adoptions for the animals in their care. With a market already available for their animals, shelters are less likely to seek out adopters, especially when an animal meets the specific requirements for a particular lab or institution.\nIn order to abolish pound seizure in the state of Kentucky, the practice must be outlawed and not left to the discretion of municipalities.

The entire coastal plain is critical for the caribou to raise their young, and caribou mothers are particularly sensitive to disruptions in their habitats. The Gwich'in people have a deep cultural and spiritual connection with the caribou, and depend on the Porcupine Caribou herd for about 80% of their diet. Without any habitat for the caribou their way of life will be threatened. Continuing with the plan to drill on the coastline would ultimately threaten the lives of the Gwich'in people, who have lived and depended on the coastal plain for generations. Human lives are not worth sacrificing for corporate greed.&nbsp;\nAside from the clear violations of human rights, destroying the Alaskan environment for oil would also be extremely harmful for polar bears.

However, they told her they could not do anything to help unless Jacob committed a crime.&nbsp;\nJacob\u2019s roommate called every day, for five days with no assistance. On the sixth day, the police were called with allegations of domestic abuse (or it could have been a disturbance) - his roommate did so because remember, they would not come unless Jacob committed a crime. The real reason they were called was for the same reason they were called every day for a week - a mental health crisis. They knew this, the dispatchers told them this.&nbsp;\nWhen they arrived Jacob was in his car outside his complex, suffering from a mental health crisis alone. The police approached Jacob\u2019s vehicle and tried to detain him. Jacob did not want to be detained - remember, he is in the midst of a mental health crisis. A struggle for detainment between the police and Jacob ensued, which ended in a police officer shooting Jacob 10+ times, unloading a full clip, killing him. He was only 26 years old, with so much life ahead of him. Police officers have tasers, batons, rubber bullets and mace. What on earth would constitute using a gun in this situation? Jacob loved and cared for everyone, and tried his best to help others even when he himself was struggling so deeply on the inside.&nbsp;\nThe police reports say he was in possession of a \u201cknife.\u201d But this knife was a pocket knife with a 1.5 inch blade that he would carry on his keychain. This small pocket knife was by law not a deadly weapon, and in no way shape or form did Jacob pose a threat.\nAfter news of his murder spread, protests and riots ensued within Tigard, Oregon, with hundreds protesting such a gross injustice. The news of Jacob\u2019s murder has been localized, but we are here to spread and disseminate it.\nA mental health crisis cannot equal a death sentence. Police departments and their forced MUST be retrained and there must be protocols in place to assist those who are obviously in need of mental health assistance. Many countries and states such as Colorado have a mental health force that arrives at a mental crisis scene prior to law enforcement, to de-escalate the situation as opposed to what the police did to Jacob. This needs to be instated in every state and county.\nWe are not asking for condolences or prayers, we are asking for help - help in getting justice for Jacob in a system that whole heartedly protects the police. If you have any extra funds, please consider donating to his twin sister\u2019s go fund me: https://www.gofundme.com/f/28xlfpc0hc You can also sign this petition to help get justice for Jacob, or spread his story if you get the chance. If you have some extra time and feel like being an activist, you could email or call Tigard, Oregon officials regarding Jacob.\nOur system needs change, and people need to be held accountable, no matter the occupational title they hold.&nbsp;\nWe are trying to reach the attention of Oregon governor Kate Brown to ensure that justice be brought upon Jacob by having the officer(s) who are responsible for his murder fired and charges immediately filed.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ea/cv/AmeAcVlFdzzcgED-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610322846"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/removepaulgosar-protect-our-constitution?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "#RemovePaulGosar - Protect our Constitution.", "description": "#RemovePaulGosar from Congress.

The one guard present that day never stepped out of her booth. I was notified of my son\u2019s murder and the circumstances surrounding his death approximately six hours after the incident, not by any prison official, but by another inmate. The officials of the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) have yet to speak with me concerning what happened to my son. Not only have they refused to speak with me, but the officials at Macon State Prison failed to secure and return Carrington\u2019s personal belongings to me, and have denied having any records on him. Carrington had been incarcerated since he was seventeen years old as a first offender on aggravated assault charges. At the time of his murder, he was just months shy of his 24 birthday, and his release from prison.\nStarting with the day my son was murdered, &nbsp;I have been lied to and given the run-around, and pretty much ignored by Warden Perry, the Facilities Director; Scott Crickmar, and the GDC. I even attempted to relay my concerns to Commissioner Timothy Ward, whose disposition was rude, defensive, and insensitive. Commissioner Ward refused to have a conversation with me and ended the call abruptly. I must admit, his response was disheartening; as I am a grieving mother whose son lost his life in one of Commissioner Ward\u2019s Prisons. As one of the \u201cGatekeepers\u201d of the GDC, I would think a conversation with a bereaved mother would be the least he could have done. I've also emailed Commissioner Ward inquiring about changes that are being implemented to help ensure the safety of other inmates; I have yet to hear from him. I\u2019ve written to the office of Governor Brian Kemp, twice, not only concerning the murder of my son, but also the rampant violence and deplorable conditions of Macon State Prison. Just like his subordinates, Governor Kemp has failed to acknowledge me and my concerns, my son's murder, and the unconstitutional conditions of Macon State Prison. I have tirelessly poured out my heart in correspondence to the U.S Department of Justice pleading for a full investigation into Macon State Prison. Again, it appears I\u2019ve fallen on deaf ears. Is there a leader anywhere who cares about this life and death issue that affects the lives of the people who\u2019ve helped put them in positions of political power?! This is not an \u201cincarcerated folks\u201d problem. This is a societal problem. What happened to Carrington is not an isolated incident, but a systemic issue of inhumane conditions, corruption, injury and death. The critical staffing shortage, improperly trained staff, lack of appropriate security and surveillance, obscured and improperly working security cameras, corruption and breakdown in communication processes have placed the Georgia Department of Corrections in a crisis. There have been far too many murders at Macon State Prison alone. Our loved ones are not coming home. And those who do are often worse off; inflicted with mental illnesses; PTSD, depression, sleep deprivation, and paranoia; from things they\u2019ve witnessed and experienced behind those prison walls. Many of these same offenders are released back into society in a continuous cycle of untreated mental illness, frequent ER visits with unpaid, and piling healthcare debt, reactive criminal thinking and recidivism.\nOur Gatekeepers need to be held accountable to the obligations of their position, and their duty to uphold the Constitution for ALL. We cannot afford for our leaders to continue to ignore this grave issue. My son, and many others have paid with their blood. Please help me in this urgent call to action for the U.S Department of Justice to launch a full investigation into the deplorable conditions of Macon State Prison, and the GDC as a whole; In hopes that what happened to Carrington will not happen to another prisoner.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/xm/xs/dAXmxsyXKKdNVzR-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609785074"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/easy-day-studios-gameplay-improvements-for-skater-xl?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Gameplay Improvements for Skater XL", "description": "SkaterXL is a skateboarding simulation, and yet it does not provide a true simulation of actual skateboarding. Skateboarding is individualistic, rooted in creativity, and a totally unique experience depending on who is on the board/behind the controller. This game as a whole would appeal to a much broader demographic (including real world skateboarders) if everyone&nbsp;had the option to control their \"stats\" like we do via mods on PC.\nA majority of the improvements on PC are simple code edits that would be trivial to add on console (including SoundMod, which, for the most part, is simply replacing a bunch of audio files), and would greatly improve the overall gameplay experience for EVERYONE, both on PC and console. Easy Day Studios, please consider adding these improvements to the base game, as they will do nothing but increase the playability, longevity, and overall enjoyment of the wonderful game that you have created. The community as a WHOLE is begging you to give us what have been staples of the PC experience to everyone, so that we can all enjoy this game to its fullest potential. PLEASE.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nMain wishes:\n\nCustomizable \"stats\" (pop height, gravity, push force, etc).\nSoundMod.\nDeck customization (width, truck size, wheel size, etc).\nPost processing options, such as XLGraphics/Babbo Settings (which literally utilize the built-in post-processing effects within the Unity Engine) would be fantastic as well.&nbsp;\n\nWe as a community believe these improvements are integral to the success of this game, and that the lack of such options is doing nothing but pushing potential (as well as current) players away.

Chesa Must Resign. Our beloved city has seen an astronomical increase in crime, even under Covid-19 restrictions. In 2020, violent crime, home invasions, rampant and unchecked drug dealing and business property theft have turned our city upside down. We citizens are sick and tired of it. Demand SFDA Chesa Boudin resign immediately.\nEvery resident and every visitor to San Francisco is a potential target. Our homes, our property and our lives are at risk.\nMr. Boudin has been in office barely a year, and in his disastrous social experiment of criminal justice \"reform\" and the so-called restorative justice model, he has instead dismantled the criminal justice system. This was not by accident- Mr. Boudin has actually planned to allow mayhem on San Francisco's streets and in our homes. He schemes to vastly favor criminals over law-abiding citizens.\nWe will involve SF Mayor London Breed\nMayor London Breed has been conspicuously quiet on this issue- and has not come forth with outrage. The city must hear from her and we will demand she condemns Chesa Boudin. We therefore implore Mayor Breed to use her voice and her podium at City Hall to join us in demanding Mr. Boudin resign.\nDismal Crime Statistics\nCrime statistics for the year ending December 2020: Burglaries are up 47% , Car thefts are up 34% , Arson 39% and Homicides over 10% . Drug overdose deaths surpassed 620 in 2020 due in part to Mr Boudin's hands-off-drug-dealers approach. Car break-ins are now so prevalent, car owners have simply stopped reporting them.\nA District Attorney is supposed to prosecute criminals\nCriminal justice, and the prosecution of crimes, is the responsibility of the District Attorney's office. Mr Boudin, as the city's chief law enforcement officer and head prosecutor, has actually declined to take on cases, thereby sending a signal to criminals than they may run free throughout San Francisco without consequence. What's more outrageous is that he cannot be fired, as he was elected.\nSF Crime Dashboard\nWe have witnessed outrageous incidents during 2020, where Mr Boudin failed to act. Every incident appears increasingly heinous, and just this New Years Eve, a paroled criminal fleeing in a stolen car hit and killed 2 pedestrians in downtown San Francisco.

The historically ceremonial process was stopped as lawmakers were forced into hiding. There were multiple deaths and injuries.\nThis was an unprecedented assault and nothing short of an attempted coup.

He has shown a flagrant disregard for the rules and our democracy. Hundreds of political scientists have signed an open letter that calls for Trump's removal from office.&nbsp;We must stop our country from backsliding into authoritarianism.

During the 2020 season, the Texans achieved a mediocre 4-12 record. While there are many people to blame for this sad state of affairs, the two main culprits are clear: Bill O'Brien and Jack Easterby. While many of you are likely familiar with the former GM and Head Coach of the Texans, Bill O'Brien, there is a lesser known figure by the name of Jack Easterby, the Executive VP of football operations, who may shoulder more of the blame for the current state of the Texans even more than O'Brien.&nbsp;\nJack Easterby is by all accounts a good man who has helped lead and inspire many young athletes over their careers. However, being a good Christian does not qualify you to have a large influence over personnel decisions, nor does it qualify you to establish a team culture. These are both things that Easterby has undertaken during his tenure with the Texans. A former chaplain for the New England Patriots,&nbsp; Easterby has somehow risen through the ranks of the Texans organization and is now considered by many to be the right hand man of Owner, Cal Mcnair. I highly reccomend reading this article by sports illustrated to gain a deeper understanding of exactly how Jack Easterby is leading the Texans down a path that will not only lead to being a mediocre football team, but alienating multiple members of the staff and more importantly, the players.&nbsp;\nOn the other side of the coin is Deshaun Watson. I can't really say more about Deshaun other than he's one of the best players in football today. He signed a massive contract extension in the offseason, and deservedly so. With a ragtag receiving corps for much of the year, Watson led the NFL in passing this season. Aside from that, Deshaun is a great humanitarian and has been since entering the League in 2017. He is a generational talent, and beyond that he's a generational player, similar to JJ Watt in his ability to not only impact a football game but the community at large. He is too important of a person to squander years of his professional career like this past year, and I fear that will continue to happen if Easterby remains.\nIt has become increasingly more clear in recent days that Deshaun is not happy with the leadership in the Texans front office, saying on Sunday, \"We need a whole culture shift. We need new energy. We need discipline, we need structure, we need a leader. We've got to have love for people and people in this organization.\"&nbsp;\nJack Easterby is the man who created the current culture on Kirby Drive in Houston.\nWhat was the Texans' response to their young star publicly clamoring for a shift in culture, a fresh start? They went out and hired Nick Caserio, director of player personnel for the New England Patriots, and by all accounts one of Jack Easterby's best friends.\nMore. of. the. same.\nIt's too early to judge Caserio, and in a vacuum it seems like a strong hire. He was part of multiple Super Bowl winning teams in New England and is credited as being a man obsessed with establishing a winning culture and creating a championship caliber team. But, his first move as GM needs to be to fire Jack Easterby. Easterby has overstayed his welcome in Houston, and while it doesn't sit well with me to campaign for another man to lose his job in the middle of a pandemic, I don't care. There is too much at stake to keep this man as part of the Texans.\nReports have come out in the league this morning that Deshaun has discussed the possibility of a trade out of Houston, something that the Texans franchise could likely never recover from.\nSo please, sign my petition and help rescue Deshaun Watson. The Texans already squandered the hall of fame careers of Andre Johnson, JJ Watt, and traded away Deandre Hopkins (in large part due to Easterby). If you care about the NFL and Deshaun Watson as an athlete and a person then help me get rid of Jack Easterby and get Deshaun the fresh start he needs. Don't do it for the Texans. Do it for Deshaun.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/mh/sw/eGmhSWDxJqBpRbQ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610043525"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/department-of-justice-stop-the-execution-of-dustin-higgs?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop the execution of Dustin Higgs!", "description": "Dustin Higgs was convicted and sentenced to the death penalty for being the accomplice to the 1996 murder of three young women.\nThe problem here is Hayes, the one who committed the ACTUAL crime was NOT sentenced to the death penalty, he was given 45 years +life by a separate jury, even though he committed the crime.

Since then, Snowbowl has made numerous modifications to its operations, some without any environmental review, public involvement, or Tribal consultation. Aerial photographs reveal Snowbowl's construction of a new parking lot in an area known as Hart Prairie, which will rapidly expand its business to a year-round model.&nbsp; In 2005, the Coconino National Forest refused to even discuss allowing an increase in daily visitation above 2,825 skiers per day, insisting that they would keep parking capacity static to prevent an increase in visitors.\nNow, a new lot is being constructed for skier use, which, along with operation of a free shuttle system, the USFS admits \u201cdecouples the previous tie between parking and visitation.\u201d&nbsp; It is is also causing severe environmental degradation and erosion of a formerly intact meadow ecosystem.&nbsp; The lot is&nbsp;being constructed without required public notice, comment and review procedures, and without Indigenous consultation.&nbsp; According to research by Sierra Club - Grand Canyon Chapter, this is just one example of several ways that the United States Forest Service is allowing violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Endangered Species Act.&nbsp; Snowbowl\u2019s desire for profit is threatening biodiversity, groundwater safety, and human communities that have been developing here for millennia.\nMost of the Indigenous Nations who revere this mountain are in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District.&nbsp; These Indigenous votes contributed to Congressman Tom O\u2019Halleran\u2019s and Senator Mark Kelly\u2019s elections in 2020.&nbsp; ICF is calling for an investigation and field hearing led by Representative O\u2019Halleran, to publicly disclose how the USFS is enabling Arizona Snowbowl\u2019s violations.&nbsp; We are calling on Rep. O\u2019Halleran to direct the Forest Service to end Snowbowl\u2019s impunity.&nbsp; The Forest Service must conduct a thorough review of cultural and environmental impacts, including required public involvement, of all modifications made at the resort since 2005, and Snowbowl must be held responsible for remediation of all environmental impacts before further business continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call for public notice and a process of public review, comment, and legitimate Indigenous consultation before Arizona Snowbowl\u2019s forthcoming Master Development Plan is reviewed by the Coconino National Forest Supervisor Laura Jo West.

Meeting the GPA requirement now hinges solely on two semesters of grades, one of them being this fall\u2019s grades during the pandemic and increased civil unrest in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;I reached out to my school for academic support early in the semester. I was given two options: withdraw without financial reimbursement (during a pandemic/economic crisis) or excel in my finals. As my school does not currently have an appeal process, this situation placed the responsibility of success entirely on me.&nbsp;\nWhile I recognize the importance of success in law school and its direct correlation to future success on the bar, I believe my school could have provided more support, options or at least the opportunity to appeal given the circumstances we are currently living under.&nbsp;In addition to the aforementioned challenges, I am currently facing housing insecurity. When I met with one of my school\u2019s deans and the Director of Students no resources were offered. The Dean of Students scoffed and laughed at my request for support, even as I described my housing insecurity.&nbsp;\nThe pandemic, and civil unrest in D.C. have made the past few months extremely challenging. Some of these extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, being stabbed by a Proud Boy, being unlawfully arrested, being subjected to slander by a national news outlet, facing housing insecurity, and receiving death threats from far-right militants.&nbsp;My law school has not made any effort to support students financially (except those with exceptional GPAs, which is unfortunately not a plausible reality for everyone right now). I have prioritized paying for my education over housing, and to now be dealing with expulsion is devastating.&nbsp;\nThis letter, with additional support from the community, will show my school that others agree the administration\u2019s actions in the face of a global pandemic and civil unrest have been preposterous.

In December, the BOE decided to&nbsp; re-evaluate the decision to return to all virtual teaching (except for some small group in-person classes) based on State BOE guidelines as follows:&nbsp; at or below 5/100,000 positive cases per week and less than 5% positivity rate in our county (at&nbsp; or above 15/100,000 cases the guideline states limited or no in-person programs). We have not met these metrics and cases are increasing. As of 1/06/21, Carroll County's positivity rate is 8.2% and as of 1/10/2021 it has 46/100,000 positive cases. Mr. Hoover described how the hospital is being strained and some surgeries must be cancelled. Science is being ignored. The more we gather in any setting, including schools, we give the virus legs to travel and spread in the community. Let's not put into harm's way the progress that has been made to have small groups of students gather for learning (special education, English language learners and Career and Tech).&nbsp;\nThe health and safety of faculty, staff and students is not of primary concern to the BOE. Despite testimony from teachers and the CCEA Union representative describing health and safety concerns, the BOE voted to resume hybrid teaching. One staff person at a middle school has passed away from COVID-19.&nbsp;\nThe main reason cited by the BOE to return to hybrid learning was the rise in students' failing grades. However, they didn't survey the community to see who would return to in-person learning and if, in fact, it is students who received failing grades in the first quarter. 660 less students are participating in hybrid learning this time than participated in October. At West Middle School only 39% of the student body returned for hybrid learning and 15 classrooms have substitute teachers supervising students. It is not an idea that is gaining traction among parents yet the BOE continues to put faculty, staff and students health and safety at risk. Hybrid learning by its nature divides a teacher's attention between the few students in the classroom and those who are online. How does this effectively address the need of students who are failing?&nbsp;\nFinally, teacher and staff morale is plummeting as the BOE demonstrates meeting after meeting that their well-being is of no concern. Our children are losing experienced educators to early retirement and long-term medical leave. BOE's short-sightedness will cause our children to have years of educational loss and lag by losing many educators to other school districts that will value their talents and humanity.\nThe BOE must reverse its January 4, 2021 decision and return to virtual learning until the State Board of Education metrics are met.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/jb/qz/UMJBQzICmjcQGVt-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610371652"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/department-of-homeland-security-stop-ice-from-deporting-women-who-are-victims-to-coerced-hysterectomies?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop ICE from Deporting Women Who are Victims to Coerced Hysterectomies!", "description": "On September 14, Dawn Wooten, an&nbsp;ex-nurse&nbsp;at the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia, filed a whistleblower complaint to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General\u2019s office, outlining concerns over medical neglect at the facility. One of the most shocking sections of the complaint, outlined concern of unwarranted hysterectomies being performed on women at the facility. The&nbsp;27-page&nbsp;complaint excluded specific names of the victims or the gynecologist in question, but after the report gained attention, brave women at these centers came forward and shared their stories. Their stories exposed Dr. Mahendra Amin\u2019s invasive procedures and unwarranted hysterectomies being performed on these women. An investigation later done by the New York Times revealed that these medical procedures were unnecessary and could have been avoided with much less invasive treatments. Furthermore, women revealed that not only were invasive procedures common, but many times, there was no&nbsp;interpreter&nbsp;present to help the women understand what procedures they were consenting to when signing consent forms.&nbsp;In response to the allegations, public support was joined with the support of lawmakers, who demanded that the Department of Homeland Security inspector general\u2019s office investigate the validity of the claims.&nbsp;\nToday, there is an ongoing investigation into the allegations by the FBI,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Justice Department, and the DHS inspector general\u2019s office, however, the women who have bravely come forward, are now being deported.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago, six women who alleged abuse from the doctor were deported. The remaining women who courageously came forward, are now facing the same imminent threat.&nbsp;\nWe must demand that no more women be deported during the ongoing investigation into the allegations. These women are vital witnesses and evidence to the investigation, and we cannot allow ICE or Dr. Mahendra Amin to get away with their actions. Excluding them from the investigation means the continuation of an improper and unjust investigation. These women have already experienced inhumane and life changing treatment and we must stand with them and demand that their human rights be protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/qn/gc/SNQngCguwHtEPbZ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607636633"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/justin-price-ri-rep-justin-price-resign?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "RI Rep. Justin Price: RESIGN!", "description": "On January 6th, domestic terrorists stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States.\nYesterday, Rhode Island Representative Justin Price (Exeter, Richmond, Hopkinton) admitted on Twitter that he was at the Capitol with the violent mob when the building was stormed. After people started noticing what he said, Rep. Price was quick to say that he did not technically go *inside* the Capitol building, but he has REFUSED to answer whether or not he crossed police lines and how close he got to the Capitol building. He has since DEFENDED the domestic terrorists who went inside the capitol and blamed the attack on left-wing infiltrators, a completely disproven attempt by people like Rep. Price to deflect from his role in instigating this violent insurrection and attack on our country.\nNot only was Rep. Price AT the attack on the US Capitol, but his anti-American actions and promotion of far-right conspiracy theories DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED to the attack on the Capitol.\nRep. Price is a traitor to our state and to our country. He has broken the oath he took to protect and serve the Constitution and is an active threat to our democracy! Rep. Price must resign immediately and cannot be allowed to represent us in the RI House of Representatives.", "image_url":

Jefferson County should not rename a part of a highway to appease a tyrannical president. Jefferson County is a growing community of scholars, hard workers, and we are increasing in the numbers of people of color moving to JeffCo and I believe that renaming such a busy stretch of the highway will only deter those who could help us keep growing.\nThere are a plethora of reasons to not rename this highway in honor of DJT but here are some to jog your memory; 1) lying to us about the dangers of COVID-19; 2) His over 25 sexual misconduct and abuse allegations; 3) his racial prejudice; 4) collusion with Russia in 2016 election; 5) losing the popular vote, TWICE; 6) he was impeached and could potentially become impeached again; And lastly, President Trump incited riots at our nation's capital- where 5 people died- in order to protest the fair and free Presidential election outcome. And at the riots, dressed from head to toe in Trump gear were White Supremacists, Nazis, and members of the KKK.\nI fear that if we rename a portion of that highway to DJT then the monsters hidden among us will feel more comfortable and Jefferson County might become a place where it is no longer safe for women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color.\nPlease consider signing this petition.

At the time Nick was just a 15-year old highschool freshman with his whole life ahead of him. That night, Nick was arrested for a local robbery. Availing himself of his right to a trial by jury, Nick believed that the court would take it easy on him. That decision would prove fateful.\nDespite his tender age, Nick was tried and sentenced as an adult to a total of 68-years with a Mandatory Minimum 33-year term for his involvement in a crime where he physically hurt no one. A consecutive mandatory sentence that the trial court erroneously believed that it was required to apply, by law.\nIn 2012, for the first time, in a separate case (Brown v. Commonwealth), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that a trial court was not required to run multiple sentences for use of a firearm consecutively with each other, effectively eliminating its application as a mandatory minimum. This ruling should have invalidated Nick's sentence. Unfortunately, the holding in Brown came several years too late for Nick's sentencing and washed away any hope in a second chance that he held.\nIn America, there has been much discussion concerning the harshness and legitimacy of mandatory minimum sentencing, especially concerning our juvenile offenders. Here we had a young, charismatic and promising African American teenager who in one fleeting instance made the biggest mistake of his life and was condemned to spend a large portion of his adult life behind bars without a chance of parole. Instead of offering him an opportunity to turn his life around and to become a contributing member of our society, he was shown that his life did not matter. As it stands, Nick would be nearly 50-years old when released. The harsh sentence was unwarranted and Nick deserves a second chance!\nDespite his too-harsh sentencing, Nick decided to do his best to better himself and has matured into a solid citizen in prison. Nick has renounced his juvenile criminal past and has demonstrated extreme remorse for his part in the robbery and has redeemed himself. Recognizing that education is the key to personal development, Nick has a very long list of academic and personal achievements earned while incarcerated, including successfully completing a series of classes and programs from Washington &amp; Lee University. Nick's professor from W&amp;L, Howard Pickett, an Associate Professor of Ethics and Poverty, has recognized Nick's talents and complete rehabilitation and is asking for Nick to get a second chance. Professor Pickett in a letter to the Governor of Virginia states that Nick \"is one of the most thoughtful and uncommonly introspective students I have taught in more than a decade of teaching at both the University of Virginia and W&amp;L\".\nWe, as a community, believe that Nick deserves a second chance at life. We believe that he should rejoin us as a contributing member of our society. If you too believe that Nick deserves a second chance, please sign our petition asking Virginia Governor Ralph S. Northam to show mercy and grant Nick clemency.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/uh/yp/ESUHYPBptGbcfKU-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608686200"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/tik-tok-stop-unnecessary-censorship-of-sex-workers-on-tik-tok?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop Unnecessary Censorship of Sex Workers On Tik Tok", "description": "Tik Tok is a lip synch platform that has been growing in popularity; for many groups of people it has helped foster community and speak out about inequalities and discrimination they experience. Sex workers are no different in that sense; we have grown a community of our own. We seek to educate the public on our job and the realities of what we experience; how we navigate the world in an industry that is frowned upon and often times disregarded by society.\nRecently, sex workers have come under fire by social media platforms. Instagram started in November of 2020, and now Tik Tok is following in their footsteps. In the new Tik Tok terms of service, which will be integrated on December 20th, 2020, it has specifically targeted sex workers in their promotion of their other platforms in order to generate income using the followings they have gained through Tik Tok.\nThe new guidelines state that Tik Tok creators can not, \"upload, stream or share content that depicts, promotes, or glorifies sexual solicitation, including offering or asking for sexual partners, sexual chats or imagery, sexual services, premium sexual content or sexcamming.\"\nNumerous sex workers have been \"deplatformed\" and have had their accounts deleted; many times also having videos taken down that have no mention their work.\nAs sex workers, we seek to educate the public on the realities of our jobs. We wish to be seen as people, we wish for our job not to dehumanize us in the publics eye, and we wish not to be put down. We wish not to have all the work we've put into growing our platforms thrown away. We wish for our work to be normalized so that stigmatization around sex work can be debunked and we can let the world know what we are; people. People with a job that helps put food on our tables, keep roofs over ours and our families head, and create futures for ourselves.\nOn a platform with so much reach, why are we discarded after our stories are used for entertainment and help the app generate income? Why can a platform benefit off of our work and we can not?&nbsp;\nThere is a common narrative in society of sex workers stories being used to market and make money, while simultaneously blocking us out from the conversation or the revenue it generates. Sex workers are continually ignored, and this brings great harm to us. By leaving us out of these conversations, stigma grows and we are left to try and mend the harm done. We are left at greater risk than before, because we were not allowed to use our voices about our own community.\nSex workers are a valid part of any community and sex work offers work to those who can not maintain the stressors of an everyday nine to five job. Sex workers on Tik Tok have created inclusive spaces, worked to educate those around us, and take care of our community; we want other sex workers to know that they are not alone. We want other sex workers to know that they are valid and that there are other people out there who know what they are going through.&nbsp;\nThe goal of this petition is to remove the guidelines that very specifically target sex workers on Tik Tok. We want to be able to advertise our other platforms without facing backlash or consequence for using the followings we have worked for to generate income for ourselves.&nbsp;\nSex workers are members of your community; we're the people in line behind you at the grocery store, we're the parents dropping our kids off at school, we're your next door neighbor. We're people, and we are people who deserve as much respect and consideration as anyone else.\nPlease stand with us, please use your voice to help us be heard, please use the power you have to help a community who is silenced by those who use us for profit.

Tragically, many people suffering in unhealthy, unsanitary conditions are dying of neglect.&nbsp;\nAct now to save parks and the environment. The human tragedies playing out in our parks are being compounded as beloved parks, green spaces and sensitive waterways are being overrun, deeply damaged, and needlessly sacrificed.

We need to act now to preserve and protect our urban forests, wildlife, and our most environmentally sensitive waterways.&nbsp;\nSeattle is one of the most educated, wealthy, and generous places in the United States. Every year, the residents of the Puget Sound area spend over $1 billion on homelessness. City of Seattle spending has more than quintupled in recent years, to a budget of $167 million for 2021, which makes it all the more difficult for community members to understand how we could have failed to prevent one of the worst homeless crises in the country.\nSolutions are as complex and varied as the reasons that people become homeless in the first place. But the one thing that everyone who is homeless has in common is they lack shelter and many now lack any place to go where they can be supported with the basics of a warm space, hygiene services, and a supportive community.\nIt\u2019s time for a true emergency response to this crisis. We know what to do. Every year communities all across America effectively respond to homelessness caused by floods, fires, and earthquakes. In the same way, we can create and utilize safe bridge shelter options such as hotel rooms, tiny home villages, Pallet shelters, and sanctioned tent communities in thousands of non-parks properties available in King County to quickly provide affordable, voluntary, safe shelter.

After years of struggling with serious mental illness, my 17-year-old son Daniel Weisberger had a psychotic break, attacking me and his brother, Pascal, and is now charged with Pascal\u2019s death. Despite this terrible outcome, Daniel greatly loved both his brother and me, and is utterly heartbroken by Pascal\u2019s loss, wishing every second of each day during the past seven months he has been in jail that his brother were still with us.\nThis tragic reality is the result of Daniel being subjected to years of physical and emotional cruelty, behavior that went on for much of his childhood, as well as a mental health system inadequate to help him overcome the serious psychological issues caused by the abuse. Despite this well-documented history, last January multiple state agencies responsible for Daniel\u2019s welfare made the egregious decision to place him back with his abuser and failed to properly safeguard that he would be treated appropriately this time.\nThe consequence of these actions was Daniel being traumatized by months of emotional and physical abuse and neglect, leading to the precipitous deterioration in his mental well-being, which ultimately triggered the actions alleged to have caused his brother\u2019s death.&nbsp;\nDespite Daniel\u2019s age and the obvious role that child abuse and mental illness played in this tragedy, the Monroe County State Attorney\u2019s office has charged Daniel as an adult and intends for him to spend decades in prison, essentially eliminating his chance for a future. Pascal\u2019s death was a tragedy beyond comprehension, but long-term imprisonment for Daniel will only lead to the lives of both boys being destroyed, when one can still be saved.\nUnfortunately, despite the wishes of our family and I, the legal system has not been pursuing a fair outcome for Daniel. Though a victim in the case, I strongly believe that Daniel being denied a future is unacceptable, and as someone who knew Pascal better than anyone, I am confident he would feel the same. That is why I\u2019m asking for your help to provide Daniel with the best legal assistance possible, to press for a resolution that will acknowledge that he is a mentally ill child in need of long-term mental health treatment, not incarceration.\nThe push for criminal justice reform and an improved mental health system have garnered increasing focus around our country. Improvements in these areas are particularly necessary with juveniles, who differ from adults in many ways, including their level of brain development and ability to make appropriate decisions. Children charged with a crime deserve to be treated in a manner that acknowledges their stage of development and emphasizes treatment and rehabilitation, especially when mental health is a contributing factor.\nEven serious crimes should be handled in light of these factors: A case in point is a noteworthy example years ago in Miami that was successfully resolved and had a number of approaches relevant and appropriate for Daniel. See https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1989-09-10-8903020457-story.html and https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1993-10-03-9309170554-story.html for further information.\nAs a father, I have always loved my boys equally, and while I continue to grieve Pascal\u2019s loss, I strongly believe that Daniel is a good person who should be helped, not incarcerated. Daniel didn\u2019t deserve to suffer the trauma of abuse and mental illness, and the truth is that no one loved Pascal more than Daniel, or is more devastated by the reality of his loss. Daniel should have received better help to overcome the struggles he has faced, but was instead placed in situations that further undermined his emotional and psychological well-being.\nThe past can\u2019t be undone, but Daniel deserves our care and support in the present. We need to ensure this time he gets the help necessary to provide a way through this terrible tragedy, and to the positive life that Pascal would want for him.\nTo support Pascal's way (https://www.facebook.com/PascalsWay.org/ )for Daniel's future, a path to redemption and a meaningful life for his brother, instead of one wasted in prison, please voice this message to the Monroe County State Attorney\u2019s Office by insisting that:\n&nbsp;(1) Daniel, who is 17, be charged as a juvenile, instead of as an adult.\n&nbsp;(2) Daniel\u2019s background with mental illness and as a victim of child abuse be strongly considered in the case against him\n&nbsp;(3) The case be resolved through a focus on mental health treatment and rehabilitation\nIf you care about Daniel's future and would also be willing to help provide him with an effective legal defense please follow this link to contribute:&nbsp;https://gogetfunding.com/support-pascals-way-for-daniels-future/", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ko/nu/vVkOnUHUZssFYkC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609661512"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/supervisor-kathryn-barger-fix-the-la-county-shelters-help-us-maximize-the-lives-saved?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Fix the LA County shelters!

Quinlan responded to Schuyler that this was not the place to bring up his concerns regarding membership. Schuyler then verbally attacked Quinlan, declaring, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have freedom of speech and you\u2019re not going to tell me it\u2019s not the place for me to bring this up.\u201d After Quinlan explained that she was attempting to utilize the position given to her by the Society to present on accessibility and inclusion in virtual conferences, Schuyler aggressively proclaimed, \u201cSieg Heil to you\u201d and raised his hand in the Nazi salute.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u201cSieg Heil, which translates to \u201cHail Victory\u201d was one of the most notorious Nazi slogans used during the Third Reich, and has since been adopted by neo-Nazi groups. The U.S. Constitution protects free speech under the First Amendment. Yet, the right to speak is not unlimited and Schuyler\u2019s words should not be protected by his \u201cright to free speech.\u201d This act was not only speech but also actual behavior because Schuyler raised his hand in a Nazi salute. These words and salute are especially harmful and offensive to Jewish people in general and especially to those whose families were murdered in the Holocaust.&nbsp;Just to illustrate the severity of Schuyler\u2019s use of this expression, it is important to note that use of this slogan is currently punishable in Germany with up to three years in prison. This exemplifies the seriousness with which Germany views the use of this term that is directly associated with the Nazi regime.&nbsp;Notably, Schuyler\u2019s blatantly antisemitic behavior took place on the same day that white nationalist rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. As media reports have shown, some of these rioters also displayed antisemitic symbols. One man wore a black \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d t-shirt, depicting a skull and crossbones and the phrase \u201cwork brings freedom\u201d an English translation of the concentration camp motto \u201cArbeit macht frei.\u201d&nbsp;Another man wore a t-shirt with the inscription 6MWE and yellow symbols originating in Italian Fascism. This acronym is common among far-right white supremacists, and stands for \u201csix million wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d referring to the Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust, and suggesting the wearer\u2019s intent and desire to continue the genocide of Jews.Schuyler has confirmed his actions to the Daily Pennsylvanian. He does not deny his use of the Nazi slogan and salute during the conference, nor does he believe that he deserves to be disciplined. Moreover, as of January 10, Schuyler had not yet presented an apology to Quinlan. &nbsp;As the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors whose family members perished under the Nazi regime, and as a University of Pennsylvania undergraduate student, I find Professor Schuyler\u2019s actions incredibly offensive and absolutely unacceptable. I, along with countless other students and community members who have signed this petition, respectfully call upon the University of Pennsylvania to immediately fire Robert Schuyler. His actions are appalling, impermissible, and utterly disgraceful. Antisemitic and racist behavior does not align with the University\u2019s values, and cannot be tolerated under any circumstance. &nbsp;While Schuyler\u2019s actions have been condemned by both the Penn Museum and Penn\u2019s Anthropology Department Chair, condemnation is not enough. Robert Schuyler must be held accountable for his actions, and should no longer hold the title of a Penn professor nor have any affiliation with Penn. As an institution, Penn must take disciplinary action to demonstrate that intolerable behavior has consequences, and to ensure that this does not happen again. &nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Useful Information:\nLink to Daily Pennsylvanian article: https://www.thedp.com/article/2021/01/nazi-salute-phrase-archaeology-conference-penn-professor-robert-schuyler&nbsp;Link to the Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s video segment of the incident: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZXPD-ndgvE&amp;feature=emb_title", "image_url": "https://static.change.org/profile-img/default-user-profile.svg"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/u-s-national-park-services-hold-petroglyph-park-ranger-accountable-in-tasing-of-indigenous-praying-man?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Hold Petroglyph Park Ranger Accountable in Tasing of Indigenous Praying Man", "description": "On Sunday, December 27 2020, Darrell House, a Native American and a Marine Veteran, was tased by a Park Ranger while praying a few feet off trail at Petroglyph National Monument.

This concurrently shut down any and all pages managed personally or professionally handled by said administrators. We believe that the disabling of their accounts was either done in error or that they have been wrongfully reported. The entire purpose of their page, their organization, and their work as a non-profit and as educational leaders is to support and elevate the field of Deaf Education. We, at California Association of the Deaf (CAD), are in full support of their past and present endeavors. Furthermore, we do not see any violation of Facebook misuse and ask you to join us in this public appeal.&nbsp;\nCurrently, when any of the Cal-ED administrators attempts to log in to Facebook, they would be met with the consistent response that their personal account has been disabled as they \u201cdid not follow Community Standards.\u201d If they attempt to appeal this decision or follow procedure requesting that it be reviewed, they have been told this decision \u201ccannot be reversed.\u201d Upon realizing such shocking disciplinary action was taken upon multiple board members, they also realized many of their personal and professional livelihoods were impacted. This action not only impacted Cal-ED and its administrators but any and all organizations they supported or were affiliated with.

This is a dangerous measure that will jeopardize the safety of students and the community. For the week ending January 8th, Blair County was classified in the \"substantial\" transmission level, the highest of three levels. The PA Department of Health recommends that counties in the substantial level adopt a fully remote learning model.\nSocial distancing will not be possible if the entire student body is in school at the same time. This is especially true in the cafeteria, where students will have to take their masks off to eat. There is simply not enough room for everyone to be spread six feet apart. Even during the hybrid model, students were not always six feet apart in classes. It would be impossible for students to be properly distanced in a full in-person model.\nThe lack of social distancing, in addition to putting students and staff at risk, would also cause a drastic increase in the amount of quarantined students. A single student testing positive could easily cause dozens of students to be quarantined. If the school district ends remote instruction, quarantined students will not be able to attend class for two weeks. This would drastically and negatively impact educational outcomes.\nAdditionally, current school policy allows students and teachers to wear face shields instead of masks. This is against CDC guidelines, which state that \"CDC does not recommend using face shields or goggles as a substitute for masks.\" Face shields do not provide an adequate level of protection and unnecessarily put students and staff at risk.\nAt the school board meeting Wednesday, every physician who called in during public comment opposed full face-to-face. We should trust the advice of our medical professionals. Students should not be asked to put the health of ourselves and our loved ones at risk just to get an education. We, as students of the Hollidaysburg Area School District, refuse to go back in person and ask that the school board reconsider their decision.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/yz/um/TuYzUmhRjqNKJJq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610637044"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/zach-klein-put-adam-coy-behind-bars-for-the-fatal-shooting-of-innocent-man-andre-hill?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Put Adam Coy behind bars for the fatal shooting of innocent man, Andre Hill.", "description": "Officers were dispatched to a \"non-emergency\" disturbance call from a neighbor who allegedly saw a man sitting in an SUV for an extended period of time, according to the Columbus Department of Public Safety.

GO TO https://linktr.ee/peaceforethiopia TO DONATE!\nOn Jun 29, 2020, and days after, there was a massive case of ethnic violence against innocent ethnic minorities, such as Amharas and Gurages, in the Oromo region after the murder of popular Oromo musician Hachalu Hundessa. This resulted in over 240 of these ethnic minorities being brutally murdered by Oromo extremists. Some organizations have reported on the dire situation that occurred in Ethiopia, while others have reported only on the government arresting several opposition leaders and political prisoners.\nThere is now much credible evidence released about the massacres that have been occurring in Ethiopia, particularly in the Oromo region, in which it is evident that several ethnic groups are suffering during this time from being under attack by groups that call themselves Queero. Businesses and homes owned by non-Oromos (Amhara, Gurage, Addis Ababa residents, etc.) have already been confirmed to be looted or burned, and there are more instances showing ethnically motivated killings. What has been occurring is not so different from what has happened during the October Massacre, in which over 80 Ethiopians were killed in one day by Queeros, extremist Oromo youth. The victims in these cases were ethnic/religious groups, such as Amharas, Hararis, Gurages, and Orthodox Oromos. This was a very strong religiously motivated massacre against Orthodox Christians. Churches were also destroyed and there is immense video evidence of this massacre. This massacre occurred because an Oromo politician, Jawar Mohammed, alleged on Facebook that government forces had arrested him, which later proved to be false. Thus, some of his admirers, the Queero, committed these atrocious crimes. Now that Jawar is actually arrested, the threat of several non-Oromo Ethiopians losing their lives is even higher.\nJawar has openly called for the deaths of Amhara people, Orthodox Christians, and other ethnicities in Ethiopia, and promotes ethnic cleansing and propaganda on OMN, the Oromo Media Network, which he is the Director of. It\u2019s true that he is an opposition leader. However, he has needed to be charged for his crimes against the Ethiopian people, and when the federal government encountered Jawar, there was a violent standoff between Jawar\u2019s people and the government forces, which led to his arrest. The government also stated that Jawar possessed several illegal weapons. In addition, when Hachalu died, his family requested that his body be sent to Ambo, which is his birthplace. This is a cultural tradition in Ethiopia, where people\u2019s bodies are buried in their hometowns. However, the government and several other sources have reported that Hachalu\u2019s fans in Addis Ababa and Jawar himself sought to prevent his body from being transported, which was against his family\u2019s wishes. This also caused an altercation with the federal forces. These events have been publicly announced by the government and are understood by Ethiopians who have been deeply following the news. This all is incredibly crucial and dangerous and has failed to be included in this organization\u2019s published findings.\nAuthorities should restore calm; however, excessive use of force by the government militia has been occurring, which has resulted in the unjust deaths of many Oromo protestors. At the same time, after Hachalu\u2019s death, many extremist Oromos on social media who praised Queeros, both in and especially outside of Ethiopia, have called for war in Ethiopia and violence against non-Oromos, particularly the Amhara people, which they suspected and even declared to be the killers of Hachalu. Amharas and non-Oromos (Gurages, Gamos, Gedeo, etc) who oppose extremism residing in the Oromo region are incredibly vulnerable to ethnic cleansing and general ethnic violence against them. In this case, the internet shut down in Ethiopia was likely a good thing since extremist views and calls for a massacre wouldn\u2019t have been as easily spread as it was during the October Massacre.\nAt the same time, many Oromos are suffering heavily at the hands of the government\u2019s military forces. In addition to mentioning how the government forces are using excessive force against Oromos protesting, mention how other Ethiopians are also suffering at the hands of the few extremist Oromo Ethiopians who are committing violent crimes against other ethnic groups.\nIn addition to the cases of ethnic violence in the Oromo region, there have also been several rounds of ethnic cleansing against Amharas and Agews in the Metekel zone of the Benishangul Gumuz region. On October 8th, Gumuz militia gunmen killed over 14 Amharas and Agews, and on September 24, they killed over 20 more. This took place less than two weeks after the huge massacre in which they killed over 89 Amhara and Agew civilians in the same Metekel Zone. Similar massacres took place in July, which left at least 14 dead. The latest case of ethnic cleansing against Amharas occurred when \u201cunidentified men opened fire on innocent civilians,\u201d on October 18 and October 21, leading to at least 31 Amhara civilians being massacred in the Gura Farda district of Bench Sheko zone in Southern Ethiopia. These cases are all confirmed by both eyewitnesses and regional and federal government officials, though the government denies that these are cases of constant ethnic cleansing, and doesn\u2019t provide protection or security to its people.\nThe most recent case of ethnic cleansing just occurred on November 1, 2020, in which the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), which is associated with the Oromo Liberation Front, massacred over 200 unarmed Amharas in West Wollega, Ethiopia. An estimated 40 OLA gunmen called Amhara residents in Dila Golala and Sekjerbi kebeles in the Gulala district of West Wollega for a meeting, and they opened fire on them. An unspecified number of people are also wounded and with life-threatening conditions. Women, children, the elderly, and the youth were all subjected to these killings, abductions, and injuries. Survivors state that a school and over 120 houses were set on fire. Bodies were not collected and relatives of the victims had been pleading to authorities to help collect littered bodies in the hope of organizing a funeral. Reports say that the Ethiopian Defense Force was deployed to the region for months due to the armed dangers of the OLA. Surviving witnesses said they begged the federal armed forces not to leave the area, but their pleas were not heard. OLA forces massacred the innocent and unarmed civilians after the Ethiopian Defence Forces withdrew from the region. The details are still coming out, however, the Oromo regional state communication bureau released a statement admitting the killing of civilians and blaming \u201cOLF/Shene\u201d and \u201cTPLF.\u201d However, there are speculations that the OLF is coordinating attacks in collaboration with its sympathizers in the Oromo region. There had been attempts by the Oromo regional government in the past to hide targeted attacks against Amharas.\nIn addition to the mentioned cases of ethnic cleansing against Amharas, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that several ethnic groups also suffer from ethnic violence, especially from Queeros, such as the Gamo, Gedeo, Walayta, Gurage, Zay, Dorze, Hararis, Siltes, and more. Also, in addition to Oromos suffering from excessive government force by the military, this has also been heavily experienced by Walaytas and Somalis. Somalis have constantly been killed by regional police, with there being no accountability or justice, which is the case for other Ethiopians who have been suffering from all of these violent forces. Afars have also been heavily suffering, as activists and officials state that militants and \u201cillegal settlers\u201d from the Issa Somali tribe are encroaching upon their land from the Somali region and Djibouti border, and attacking civilians. Somalis also claim the same grievances, as this is also a case of constant ethnic violence. The government hasn\u2019t provided any security or protection for them either. In all of these cases of violence, it\u2019s very important to emphasize that children and women are never spared and often face the bluntest of these killings. Sources documenting these cases will be attached below.\nOn behalf of the safety of all Ethiopians--and especially on the ethnicities that are currently facing unjust retaliation by Oromo extremists, such as the Queero-- We ned the government international and domestic to denounce, condemn, and investigate both the government\u2019s excessive use of force, and the ongoing ethnic motivated killings against Ethiopians that are happening throughout Ethiopia, and especially in the Oromo region. The government isn\u2019t taking any precautions to protect its people.

Collins, Francis W. O\u2019Brien and Joseph P. Shea - are moving forward with plans to lease 25 acres of Walpole\u2019s forest and farmland to a commercial solar development company, Kearsarge Energy. With precious little open space remaining in Walpole and across Norfolk County, the land in question holds great purpose and value beyond serving as a repository for solar panels. We are asking the County Commissioners to cooperate with the Walpole Preservation Alliance (WPA) and state and local agencies to create a fair and reasonable solution to satisfy the best interests and needs of the Town of Walpole, Norfolk County and their residents.\nThe project as proposed would take 17.5 acres of the fields and forest on North Street, and a further 7.5 acres of mature forest on the campus of Norfolk County Agricultural High School (\u201cthe Aggie\u201d), and convert those lands into large-scale solar plants. The existing trail system in both locations would be destroyed and the Aggie cross country course and Haunted Hayride route, along with the natural hands-on learning environment for a number of Aggie classes, would be eliminated.\nIn its presentation to the Walpole Select Board on 8/4/20, Kearsarge Energy omitted showing typical project details such as maintenance roadways up to and surrounding the solar panels and additional acres of tree clearing at the perimeter of the array to eliminate the casting of shadows on the panels. They also failed to show the path of interconnection lines from the array to the transmission lines, which typically consists of a pole-mounted overhead line next to a stabilized roadway able to support heavy maintenance vehicles. These things combined can occupy up to 60% or more land than the panels themselves.\nThis proposal is in direct contravention of the State\u2019s \u201cModel Zoning for the Regulation of Solar Energy Systems\u201d, published by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) in 2014 as follows: \"DOER strongly discourages locations that result in significant loss of land and natural resources, including farm and forest land, and encourages rooftop siting, as well as locations in industrial and commercial districts, or on vacant, disturbed land. Significant tree cutting is problematic because of the important water management, cooling, and climate benefits trees provide.\"\nThe Department\u2019s recommendation is clear. Large-scale solar projects should first utilize places like the rooftops of public buildings, landfills, and unused highway land, rather than farm and forest land.\nFurther, this proposal violates the Town\u2019s zoning laws and goes against a core objective of Walpole\u2019s 2020 Open Space and Recreation Plan: to \"encourage the preservation and conservation of agricultural parcels and large forested parcels and to identify\" and \"protect wildlife habitats and corridors, particularly those of endangered and threatened species\". It would also compromise the existing green corridor especially on the North Street fields, which sit on the border of BioMap2 land designated by MassWildlife as Core Habitat and Critical Natural Landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIt is ironic that Norfolk County, who has responsibility for teaching students to preserve and manage agricultural land, is proposing to lease a large part of their precious open space for a project that is in direct conflict with the State\u2019s own recommendations.\nConcerned neighbors under the banner of the Walpole Preservation Alliance (WPA) have worked individually and in concert with the Town of Walpole to reach a mutually beneficial arrangement with the County -- whereby the County would receive the money it is seeking and the Town would retain its open space. The County has refused all opportunities to pursue an alternative solution.\nWPA supports solar energy and the educational value it can provide to the students of Norfolk County Agricultural School, and we believe&nbsp;that educational objectives can be achieved&nbsp;with rooftop solar panels already in progress at the campus.&nbsp;\nIf, like us, you believe we should preserve this precious open space and site solar farms on previously disturbed locations, please sign and share this petition to show Norfolk County they are acting against your wishes.\nAdditional comments can be sent to Michael Mullen, Norfolk County Director at mmullen@norfolkcounty.org\nWe are grateful for your support,Walpole Preservation Alliance\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WalpolePreservationAlliance.org", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/ql/df/nFQldfJgvbmfclu-800x450-noPad.jpg?1604178958"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/niagara-arts-and-cultural-center-remove-yowawa-media-from-the-nacc?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Remove Yowawa Media From The NACC", "description": "Yowawa Media has been giving a platform to fascist groups who committed treason on January 6th by taking place in the failed coup at our Nation's capitol building.\nThe podcasts that they air are riddled with hate speech, transphobia, sexism and false information about the global pandemic.\nThe first amendment is absolutely important, but not when it is giving fascism a platform and when it encourages behavior that is a threat to the health and well being of everyone in our community.

By awarding Ricks you have dismissed the unethical actions of Eli Lilly and Company under his leadership.\nThere is currently an insulin price crisis in the United States. One that has existed for years and continues to be exacerbated by insulin manufactures, pharmacy benefit managers, and insurance companies. Eli Lilly and Company is a primary cause of this crisis.\nDuring Ricks\u2019 time at Eli Lilly, the price for one vial of Humalog, a popular analog insulin manufactured by Eli Lilly, increased by 1,480% (from $21 in 1999 to $332 in 2019 per vial). Many people living with insulin-dependent diabetes use two to four vials per month. This insulin price-hike is accompanied by no change to the insulin analog formula.&nbsp;\nI am a person living with Type 1 Diabetes. This means that my body does not produce insulin and I rely on injected insulin every day. Eli Lilly and Co. is one of three major companies that produce insulin in the U.S. Insulin is as necessary as oxygen. Every human being requires insulin to live, but for those of us with insulin-dependent diabetes, we have to pay exorbitant prices for this vital hormone.\nOur community has seen tragedy and death because of the high cost of insulin. Some have turned to online black-markets to share insulin. Some have tried Patient Assistance Programs only to be denied, confused, or left helpless. Some have sacrificed their careers, savings, and rent, all to afford insulin. Some have rationed their insulin causing life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis.&nbsp;\nOn June 27, 2017 the diabetes community lost Alec Smith, a 26 year-old man who was unable to afford his insulin. Out of this tragedy and hearts of advocates came a law in his honor, the Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act of Minnesota. Under this Act, Minnesota residents can access a 30-day emergency supply of insulin at the pharmacy for no more than $35. Hours before the legislation took effect on July 1, 2020, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, filed a lawsuit against Minnesota.&nbsp;\nDave Ricks serves on the board and is the chairman-elect of the PhRMA. Both PhRMA and Eli Lilly use lawsuits, patent abuse, and lobbying power to silence the efforts of patient advocates. Under the leadership of Ricks, they take advantage of our vulnerable community simply because they can.&nbsp;\nWords from the Diabetes Community\nThe company I work for was ranked #1 Best Place to Work in Indiana for 2020. Despite this I struggle to afford the Eli Lilly insulin that is manufactured in my hometown. Therefore, I am required to obtain Eli Lilly insulin through advocates online willing to supply me. When I cannot find insulin through my online diabetic community, I purchase Eli Lilly insulin from Canada at a fraction of the price. Because of this I do not feel that my life is valued by David Ricks, Eli Lilly or my local community.\n- Tommy LeStourgeon\nDuring my pregnancy I lost my job which resulted in me losing my insurance. Because I was pregnant though I was able to get on State insurance and was taken care of medically. 4 months after My son\u2019s birth my state insurance expired and my husband made too much to get back on state insurance but not enough for us as a family to afford health insurance that covered my diabetic needs. I was desperate. I had insulin but not enough to last more than 6 months. And no way could I afford $1500 a month on inulin. So Was forced to ration. This led to numerous DKA where I almost lost my life as well as Irreversible damage done to my eyes and kidneys. The fact that a drug that I need to be able to survive costs so much that I have to choose between feeding my son, being a present mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend is absolutely disgusting and sad. People are losing their lives over this. Eli Lilly should take this into consideration and lower their prices so this STOPS happening&nbsp;\n- Natalie Swanson&nbsp;\nI have struggled to survive due to the business practices of Eli Lilly under David Ricks leadership. I have had to buy insulin from Canada for $35 per vial shipped to me from Turkey. The insulin I received was the same Eli Lilly insulin that at my neighborhood pharmacy blocks from my house was almost $300 per vial. I have had to ration my insulin to make it last as long as I could. This leads to not controlling my blood sugar causing further complications that impact my life and finances as well. I ask as someone who lives with the struggle to survive daily due to David Ricks unethical business practices that you give this award to someone who shows Hoosier hospitality in their business practices towards the people not only of Indiana, but the world.&nbsp;\n- Craig Miller from Greenwood, IN\nI am deeply disturbed to see the Indiana Chamber of Commerce celebrate CEO Dave Ricks regardless of his company\u2019s unethical business practices. Furthermore, I expect you to hold the executives accountable for the actions of their companies. As a member of the diabetes community I ask the following of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce:\n\nAcknowledge the grievances of the diabetes community.\nMeet with an independent patient-led advocate coalition to discuss the unethical business practices of Eli Lilly and Company.&nbsp;\nUrge Dave Ricks and PhRMA to drop the lawsuit against the state of Minnesota.\nUrge Dave Ricks and Eli Lilly and Co. to substantially lower the list price of insulin.\nRevoke this award.&nbsp;\n\nTo conclude, I will leave you with the words of Sir Frederick Banting, a true leader who pioneered the extraction of insulin and sold its patent for $1. \u201cInsulin belongs to the world, not to me.\u201d\nCaylan Fazio\nType 1 Diabetic&nbsp;\nColumbus, Ohio\n&nbsp;\nPlease share this letter and petition with the hashtags #insulin4all and #ProtectAlecsBill.\nThose living with insulin-dependent diabetes (or caretakers) are welcome to reach out to me via social media to include your story and name in this open letter.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/ds/as/qkdSAsGAzCLcDjx-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605279169"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/save-el-pino-from-being-cut-down?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Save El Pino From Being Cut Down", "description": "El Pino is the heart of Boyle Heights and East LA.

Ms. Montgomery\u2019s execution is scheduled for December 8, 2020. Below is a statement from Kelley Henry, one of Ms. Montgomery\u2019s attorneys.\u201cFew human beings have lived through the kind of torture and trauma that was inflicted on Lisa Montgomery by her mentally ill, alcoholic mother. From a young age, Lisa was sexually trafficked, told she had to \u2018earn her keep,\u2019 and repeatedly gang raped by adult men. The abuses Lisa endured exacerbated a genetic predisposition to mental illness inherited from both sides of her family. She suffers from complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and to this day must maintain a complex regimen of anti-psychotic medications to control her episodic psychosis.\u201cIn the grip of her mental illness, Lisa committed a terrible crime. Yet she immediately expressed profound remorse and was willing to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence with no possibility of release. Lisa then was represented at trial by an incompetent lawyer who has the dubious distinction of having more clients on federal death row than any other attorney. He failed to present Lisa\u2019s jury with competent evidence about her traumatic history and severe mental illness, instead presenting pseudo-science through a witness who was not even a licensed mental health professional. And instead of recognizing Lisa as a trafficking victim, the government suggested she was complicit in the incest and abuse she suffered.\u201cLisa Montgomery has long accepted full responsibility for her crime, and she will never leave prison.

Carlos was victimized by an unjust judicial system whose scales are imbalanced framing African American men by a corrupt justice system.\nWE NEED YOUR SIGNATURE TO HELP FREE AN INNOCENT MAN, Carlos story is one of tainted trials and stolen justice. Carlos Harris was wrongfully convicted for the attempted murder of Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Carr, assault with a deadly weapon and robbery in concert on August 23, 2005. Carlos has maintained his innocence to date. Please sign this petition and share so we can present this to the Governor. Carlos has a family he needs to get back to: his wife, children and mother. Please read his story below.\nCarlos co-hosted a BBQ at a friends apartment complex labor day weekend in 2004. He invited his family and friends to join him and celebrate the holiday at a close friend\u2019s home. Carlos left the BBQ at the apartment complex early to meet up with a friend he ran into earlier that day. On the evening of the BBQ in the laundry room of Carlos friend\u2019s apartment complex Robert Bobby Carr was robbed and attacked by Carlos\u2019s co-defendants. Carlos was not aware of the attack until much later that evening when he was picked up down the street from the apartment complex by his wife and several associates (friends) who confessed to the setup, robbery and attempted murder of Robert Bobby Carr which Carlos was not apart of. Robert Bobby Carr recovered the attack and eventually submitted a written statement&nbsp; identifying his attackers and Carlos does not fit the description. The victim stated he never met/saw Carlos before.\nThe victim (Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Carr) was absent during the jury trial so Carlos was never able to face his accuser nor was he ever picked out in a police line up by the victim during the investigation. There were several eye witness statements that went ignored and they never made it to the witness stand during the trial. Carlos\u2019s guilty co-defendants perjured testimony and made deals with the District Attorney (DA) to receive light sentences.&nbsp; Also the ineffective court appointed representative never called any of the witnesses to take the stand during the jury trial that would have proved Carlos\u2019s innocence. There are multiple instances of inadequate counsel and poor representation in this case as well as direct mis-conduct and abuse of power from the District Attorney and presiding judge. As a result Carlos was convicted and sentenced to 28 years and 4 months in prison having served 16 years to date.\nCarlos has been fighting to prove his innocence since his conviction. Since then he filed an unsuccessful appeal and a writ of habeus corpus to prove his innocence and expose the mis-handling of his case from a legal standpoint as Carlos was sentenced to 28 years and 4 months, a double sentence based on an illegal enhancement that was enforced based on a prior conviction/plea agreement in 1991 that&nbsp; was never proved or stated at the time to be a strike and has nothing to do with the current case nor was deemed a violent crime.\nAll of Carlos\u2019s co-defendants took plea bargains and are out of prison and he has served 16 years of a 28 year sentence for a crime he did not commit. Carlos did not take the DA\u2019s deal because he is innocent. Carlos was railroaded during the trial:\nDuring the trial one of the jurors was biased, a former teacher that didn\u2019t like Carlos from high school.\nCarlos\u2019s due process rights were violated when the trial court informed the jury that he and the co-defendants were accomplices as a matter of law when he had not been proven guilty by the courts yet.\nCarlos requested a Marsden hearing during the trial and was denied counsel of his choice over the court appointed attorney due to a corrupt judicial system starting with the District Attorney and Judge that was presiding over his case. There were many instances of ineffective assistance of counsel and conflicts of interest during the trial (to many to list them all, multiple threats from the DA and judge toward Carlos, coerced testimonies, and not to mention the judge and the court appointed representative were close friends outside the courtroom and the public defendant withheld evidence that would have proved Carlos\u2019s innocence and kept several&nbsp; witnesses from testifying on Carlos\u2019s behalf.) Judicial Performance was requested and&nbsp; the judge retaliated against Carlos.\nAlso the courts abused its discretion during sentencing and Carlos\u2019s Romero motion was denied although he did not have a strike for a prior conviction in 1991 as the 3 strikes law did not go into effect until 1994 in California. The prior crime from 1991 was a misdemeanor and Carlos served 8 months in jail and was released based on a plea agreement. The court papers were altered and overlooked as we have written proof of the previous conviction.&nbsp;\nDespite all the injustices listed above we continue to fight for Carlos to be released. At this time we are requesting Carlos be released for time served (16 years) or exonerated. Carlos has served the full sentence for a crime he did not commit and is being detained illegally for a strike that does not exist.&nbsp; \nDonations made through this site support Change.org.&nbsp;PLEASE SUPPORT CARLOS'S DEFENSE FUND through Gofundme at https://www.gofundme.com/f/free-carlos-harris.

Courtney was raised in Plainfield, IL. She loved playing Rugby, cheerleading, Irish dancing, playing hockey and was adventurous. Courtney was also, a proud dog mama to her baby Harle.\nIn 2018, Courtney met a boy online, started dating &amp; moved down to Nakina, NC. The relationship started off good, but things became toxic. Courtney's boyfriend struggles with drug addiction. In September 2019, Courtney &amp; her partner got into a disagreement which resulted physical. According to the medical report impression-Courtney was beaten. The report read: facial laceration, facial contusion, mild concussion, laceration repair &amp; ASSAULT. This is an example of one of the many disagreements between the couple.\nFebruary 2, 2020 Courtney passed away in her home with her boyfriend present. Courtney's Cause of Death was an accidental Fentanyl and Heroin Intoxication. Courtney's&nbsp;autopsy diagnoses read; Fentanyl and Heroin intoxication, Pulmonary edema and congestion, Mild patchy bronchopneumonia, minor blunt force injuries to head, torso and extremities. Courtney\u2019s autopsy had multiple pages describing marks/bruises/gashes/broken bones. Unfortunately due to the circumstances of Courtney's Cause of Death, the case has been closed. No one from the Columbus County Sheriff's Office is returning her mother's phone calls.&nbsp;\nCourtney was not a drug user. There are several text messages and voice memos between the couple that Courtney is pleading for the boyfriend to stop using. Her pleading with him, caused explosive outbursts of anger towards her resulting in physical and mental abuse. &nbsp;According to the 911 call placed on February 2, 2020, the 911 dispatcher asked the boyfriend numerous times if there was any drugs involved. The boyfriend responded saying no, she never did drugs. Therefore, for someone who does not do drugs, for her to pass with drugs in her system it is VERY ALARMING. There was never a proper investigation completed.&nbsp;There was never a statement taken by the boyfriend for the incident that occurred on February 2, 2020.\nPlease stand with us- sign our petition to encourage the Columbus County Sheriff's Office to re-open Courtney Heater's Death Investigation.

I have been lucky enough to find that perfect dog and bond and create a life I honestly never imagined. To say he has saved my life on multiple occasions is an understatement. My Charlie is more in tune with me than I am with myself. Before Charlie I lost my family dog (Kobi) to old age which hit me extremely hard, he was my best friend since I was in 5th grade. After Kobi, my family gifted me with a German Shepherd puppy (Ramsay). Ramsay was in my life for about a month before he became suddenly ill and I lost him too. I was in no way ready to open my heart again until I saw Charlie. He was and always has been meant to be. Everything happened so I can find him and so he could change my life completely.&nbsp;\nI have always respected and understood the need for Service Dogs and think it's absolutely an amazing thing to offer for those who need it. As for Emotional Support animals, because they're not protected under the ADA there is nothing from making the ESA rules and regulations more strict, only left to ban. I think there are absolutely other solutions rather than banning them entirely. There are PLENTY of people who have ESA's who have NOT abused the privilege and have done right by it, including Charlie &amp; I. We traveled via aircraft, we go to stores, and public events and have never had and continue not to have any issues. We always work on socializing and obedience in public, we practice in busy settings and new settings. He also performs tasks naturally. He can sense when my stress and anxiety are more than normal and physically performs tasks such as, muzzling me (forcing me to pet him) he paws at me or he will even jump up to put his paws on my shoulder. In public I get social anxiety, when he senses it spike he rubs his head against me until I pet him which then reduces the stress. I know I'm not the only one lucky enough to experience this type of bond with their dog. We can find ways to help others out there like us who have done all the right things, but are being punished for the ones who decided they didn't want to pay for a pet fee for their peacock.&nbsp;\nThis past Christmas my family decided to rent an AirBnB. 24 hours upon arrival the owners/host changed their minds about me bringing along my ESA Charlie and charged us an extra $2500 in order for him to come. My family, knowing 100% he is more than just my pet paid it with no hesitation. It's instances like this that should not be allowed to happen. If Emotional Support Animals were protected under the ADA, rules and regulations would have to change completely making it more strict for people to have an official ESA and making it even harder to take advantage of.\nPlease help those who actually need this privilege and do right by it. I've done everything in my control to do right by my ESA and I will not be sticking him in cargo when we travel and should never have to pay $2500 to ensure he spends Christmas with me. I know we are not the only ones out there who would continue to do our duties as ESA owners and to ensure the banning of them doesn't happen.

Shortly after this incident, SJPD promoted Pina to Sergeant.&nbsp;\nWith Jacob gone, his entire family struggles with deep loss and disbelief. His mother grieves daily. They took her only son - her firstborn taken away from her in such a tragic and horrific way. Jacob\u2019s kids lost their daddy. His wife, a full time nurse has to try and pick up the pieces to raise their babies without their rock. His sister is left trying to explain to her son that his Brodie isn\u2019t coming back, that he\u2019s with Jesus. Losing Jacob has had a huge impact on their entire family. The cops judged him for his past, but we will all continue to fight for his future.\n#JusticeForMarissa&amp;Paea&nbsp;\nIn May of 2019, couple Marissa Santa Cruz and Paea Tukuafu were celebrating Marissa\u2019s 22nd birthday at a hotel in San Jose, CA.

Even after doing so, FIVE San Jose Police officers showed up and escalated it into violent interaction using batons, tasers and rubber bullets on Marissa and Paea. The couple suffered major injuries that required a trip to the hospital and spent the night in jail - with no criminal charges filed on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSergeant Mike Pina was there that night directing the other officers in this violent attack - He asked if they were on parole, threatened them with jail, pulled Marissa to the ground face first, shot them with tasers, and instructed other officers to attack this young couple.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n#FireSJPDOfficerMikePina\nMike Pina is a dangerous and reckless officer who should not be anywhere near our communities.

Juan was unarmed. Juan died of his injuries the following night, only hours after his family learned of the incident and was informed of his condition by hospital doctors. Juan\u2019s sons were not allowed in the hospital to say goodbye to their father.\nJuan was a sweet and loving partner and father who adored his family. He was also a talented and well-respected chef in the Napa Valley restaurant industry. Juan\u2019s kind and generous nature brought him to the Napa Valley Commons area the night of October 5th, delivering pizzas to friends evacuated during the Glass Fire, where he was later shot and ultimately killed by Sgt. Ackman. Juan\u2019s killing is unjustifiable and has destroyed his family.&nbsp;\nThe Napa County Major Crimes Task Force, consisting of the Napa County District Attorney\u2019s Office, the Napa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the Napa Police Department, are conducting their own investigation of the incident but have thus far failed to release critical evidence to the attorneys representing Juan\u2019s family. There is no peace for his family but rather a litany of unanswered questions and a resolve to fight for justice for their beloved father, husband, son, brother, and friend. Juan\u2019s family, friends, and the community demand transparency in the investigation into his killing as well as accountability for Sgt. Ackman\u2019s actions, specifically that:\no&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete body camera footage as well as the dashboard camera footage from Sgt. Ackman\u2019s patrol car must be released to the family attorneys. Only the partial body camera footage that was released to the public was shared with the family.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; The security camera footage from the neighboring businesses adjacent to where the shooting took place must be released to the family attorneys. The Napa County Major Crimes Task Force has refused to release the security camera footage to the family attorneys and have coordinated amongst themselves to suppress said footage.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; Juan\u2019s autopsy report must be immediately released to the family attorneys. The Sheriff\u2019s Office has refused to release the autopsy report making it impossible for the family to finalize Juan\u2019s death certificate. Furthermore, officers prevented the family from documenting Juan\u2019s injuries in the little time they had with him in the hospital. Their time with him was limited because officers prioritized interrogating the family rather than informing them that Juan was in the hospital or of his injuries. It is crucial that the autopsy report be released immediately.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; An outside, independent task force and special prosecutor must be called in to investigate Juan\u2019s killing and Sgt. Ackman\u2019s actions to prevent any type of coverup. The Sheriff\u2019s Office has already defended Sgt. Ackman\u2019s actions. Their claims that Sgt. Ackman attempted to deescalate the situation differ greatly from the released body camera footage. Furthermore, prosecutors in the DA\u2019s Office work with local law enforcement on a daily basis, making it very difficult for them to prosecute one of their own. The DA\u2019s Office claims that it will take them approximately six months to decide if charges will be brought against Sgt. Ackman. This is in addition to the six to eight months it will take the Sheriff\u2019s Office to conclude their own investigation. In contrast, the decision to bring criminal charges against a civilian shooter would be decided in days. An independent investigation is necessary.\nWe demand transparency in the investigation into Juan\u2019s unjustifiable killing and demand that Sgt. Ackman be held accountable for his actions. As a community we want to feel safe and assured that an officer, especially a sergeant with 21 years of experience in the department, would use every other measure available to deescalate and prevent such a senseless killing of an unarmed man. Juan leaves behind three sons, the youngest of only seven years, who will continue to live and grow in the Napa community. Please add your name to this petition to demand justice for Juan and to demand a better and safer community for Juan\u2019s sons. &nbsp;\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nEn la noche del 5 de octubre de 2020, a Juan Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, un residente de Napa de 47 a\u00f1os de edad y padre de tres hijos, le dispar\u00f3 varias veces el sargento del alguacil del condado de Napa David Ackman despu\u00e9s de una parada de tr\u00e1fico rutinaria.

Tambi\u00e9n era cocinero talentoso y muy respetado en la industria de los restaurantes del valle de Napa. Su humor amable y generoso le trajo al \u00e1rea de los Napa Valley Commons la noche del 5 de octubre, llevando pizza a sus amigos evacuados por el incendio Glass, d\u00f3nde despu\u00e9s le dispar\u00f3 y \u00faltimamente fue asesinado por Sgt.

El asesinato de Juan es injustificable y ha destruido a su familia.\nEl comando de los cr\u00edmenes mayores del condado de Napa, contando con la oficina de la fiscal del condado de Napa, la oficina del alguacil del condado de Napa y el departamento de polic\u00eda de Napa, est\u00e1n llevando a cabo su propia investigaci\u00f3n del incidente, pero hasta el momento ha fallado a proporcionar evidencia crucial a los abogados representando a la familia de Juan.

La familia de Juan, sus amigos y la comunidad exigen la transparencia en la investigaci\u00f3n del asesinato de \u00e9l adem\u00e1s de hacer responsable al Sgt.

El comando de los cr\u00edmenes mayores del condado de Napa se ha rechazado entregar el metraje de las c\u00e1maras de seguridad a los abogados de la familia y se ha coordinado entre ellos mismos para ocultarlo.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; Se entrega inmediatamente el reporte de la autopsia de Juan a los abogados de la familia. La oficina del alguacil se ha rechazado entregar el reporte de la autopsia haci\u00e9ndole imposible finalizar el acta de fallecimiento de Juan. Adem\u00e1s, los oficiales del comando le impidieron a la familia documentar las heridas de Juan en el poco tiempo con \u00e9l en el hospital. Su tiempo con \u00e9l fue limitado porque los oficiales del comando priorizaron la interrogaci\u00f3n de la familia de Juan en vez de notificarle que estaba en el hospital o de sus heridas. Es crucial que se entrega el reporte de la autopsia inmediatamente.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; Se interviene un comando independiente y desde afuera y un fiscal especial para investigar el asesinato de Juan y las acciones del Sgt. Ackman para prevenir cualquier encubrimiento. La oficina del alguacil ya ha defendido las acciones del Sgt. Ackman. Su afirmaci\u00f3n de que el Sgt. Ackman intent\u00f3 reducir la escala de la situaci\u00f3n se difiere mucho del metraje de la c\u00e1mara del cuerpo publicado. Adem\u00e1s, los fiscales de la oficina de la fiscal trabajan diariamente con los cuerpos policiales locales haci\u00e9ndole dif\u00edcil procesar uno de ellos mismos. La oficina de la fiscal dice que tomar\u00e1 aproximadamente seis meses en decidir si llevar\u00e1 a cabo cargos al Sgt. Ackman.

In addition, we request acceleration lanes at the same intersection and at the intersection of Red Leaf Blvd. and Highway 52.\nFoxbank Plantation includes almost 1,500 homes with many more planned or under construction. Not only do the residents of the neighborhood use this intersection every day, but there is also an elementary school with its associated traffic, a fire station, a daycare, and a growing number of businesses that all use this intersection daily. A new Parker\u2019s gas station is also being built at that location, which will draw in even more vehicles. With the addition of a traffic light, not only would the number of accidents decrease significantly, but the school traffic would be more easily controlled and the fire department would be able to more easily exit the neighborhood in the event of an emergency. Traffic coming out of Moncks Corner would also be improved without the frequent collisions blocking traffic. This would benefit not only Foxbank residents, but residents of surrounding neighborhoods and first responders.&nbsp;\nAt present, there are multiple vehicle collisions at the intersection of Foxbank Plantation Blvd. and Highway 52 every month. Anyone that tries to exit at this intersection is aware of how difficult it can be at times; turning right onto Highway 52 involves accelerating from a stop to 60 MPH while avoiding oncoming vehicles, and is further complicated when a vehicle trying to turn left at the same intersection blocks the view of oncoming traffic. Likewise, vehicles turning into the neighborhood from Highway 52 are often met with a long line, particularly when Foxbank Elementary releases students for the day. Matters are further complicated when a vehicle is exiting the storage facility across from the neighborhood entrance, as they use the same median area. It is only a matter of time until there is a major accident and people are seriously injured or killed. With the presence of the school and daycare, unfortunately the chances of a child being involved in a serious accident is compounded.\nTherefore, it is our suggestion that additional traffic studies be completed at the intersections of Highway 52 and Foxbank Plantation Blvd. and Highway 52 and Red Leaf Blvd. We also suggest the installation of a traffic light at the Foxbank Plantation Blvd. exit as well as acceleration lanes at both intersections. With the growing number of homes and businesses, the problem will only become worse until something is done.

But I also think Texans would agree that we take pride in what we do and expect others to do the same.

I thought, \u201cthis isn\u2019t the way we do things here.\u201d I felt deceived when I read on Wingstop\u2019s website that \u201cTreating animals well is important to our guests and our company...We value suppliers that take a continuous improvement approach to animal welfare, and we consider that in making our sourcing decisions.\u201d After doing some research, I realized that Wingstop was saying one thing and doing something very, very different.\nCurrently, chickens raised for Wingstop\u2019s supply chains live a life of pure torture. They are bred to grow at an alarmingly unnatural rate, which causes leg deformities, organ failure, and heart attacks in these baby birds. Each flock, which consists of tens of thousands of birds, are kept in dirty, windowless sheds. They are forced to live in their own waste with ammonia levels so concentrated that many suffer from chemical burns. When these birds are brought to slaughter, they are violently shackled upside down. Their throats are then slit, often while they\u2019re still conscious.\nBut Wingstop has the opportunity to vastly improve the lives of the chickens it uses for the meat on its menu by adopting the Better Chicken Commitment, a comprehensive set of welfare reforms that address the worst abuses suffered by chickens on today\u2019s farms. Over 200 companies have already signed on to this commitment, and I believe that Wingstop should join!\nConsumers across the globe are demanding more transparency about the sources of their food\u2014especially with regard to animal welfare. In response, restaurants, from Burger King to TGI Fridays to White Castle are stepping up to the plate and committing to doing better.&nbsp;\nI hope you will join me in urging Wingstop to keep moving in the right direction for its customers, the animals in its supply chain, and the planet\u2014and to do a better job at representing Texas.\nWingstop: please adopt the Better Chicken Commitment!", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/ru/jt/gZruJTjqNxLmHFM-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609982651"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/president-stuart-bell-the-university-of-alabama-cancel-in-person-classes-mandate-covid-testing?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "The University of Alabama - Cancel In-Person Classes &amp; Mandate COVID Testing", "description": "After winning the National Championship on Monday evening, a crowd of UA students and Bama supporters crowded the Strip in celebration.

He was carded and had a fake Id. Even the officers questioned his identity due to the id found on him. They were provided with the bar tab showing NO EVIDENCE of him being over served!

The owner and employees have been nothing but helpful and willing to cooperate to find out what happened that night. Yes we have had problems with citations but NOT DUE TO OVER SERVING, CARDING, or SERVING TO MINORS!

No signs of even being intoxicated while at the bar let alone being overly intoxicated! The Barbee Landing has NOT had a reoccurrence of police being called, underage serving, or over serving now or prior to this incident! He entered other bars with same id and served! Only because there was video of him leaving Barbee Landing they are being punished! HE AND HIS FRIEND CASHED OUT AND LEFT FOR SOME TIME THEN RETURNED.

Over the past couple years applications for these permits has skyrocketed and Connecticuts Department of Energy and Environmental Protection involvement has dwindled. Any person or company in the world can legally apply for a permit to Connecticut DEEP for any reason and get a rubber stamp approval. If no approval is given, there is also a loophole within the current laws that if no response is given to applicant within 24 hours, it is deemed automatically approved. These herbicide applications are approved under the guise of treating the invasive species Milfoil. An aquatic plant which has been in mostly all water bodies in CT for decades.\nThe problem with the herbicides is tenfold. The&nbsp;treatment process is never supervised. Often companies use much larger doses and cover much larger areas than permitted on application. The herbicides often used destroy all vegetation in its path eliminating habitat for fish, shellfish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, etc. Several times anglers throughout the state have witnessed fish kills on the Housatonic Water Shed, mainly Lake Lillinonah. When brought to the attention of DEEP, they turn a blind eye and ignore it then deny it ever happened. Companies that spray these chemicals claim spot treatment is possible. This is not the case on river systems as current drifts the chemical downstream of the application. Another key issue that has been overlooked is the detrimental affect these herbicides have on pets such as dogs. Veterinarians across the state have been seeing a rise in cases of Gastroenteritis. Not only from swimming in lakes that have been treated but also from small ponds. Areas where dogs get small amounts of exposure over long periods of time. Aquatic vegetation is waters natural filter, by eliminating it water clarity drops dramatically and also creates a environment for the toxic blue-green algae blooms to occur and flourish. The State of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recognizes studies that show, herbicide applications greatly increases the risk of deadly Cyanobacteria Outbreaks by a factor of six.\nCompanies that execute these treatments consistently fail to notify the public, post proper signage, use proper dosages, exceed scope of application area, and are never held accountable. This creates a very hazardous situation for residents who wish to enjoy time on the water unknowingly exposing themselves to these hazardous chemicals. Exposure to humans can cause respiratory failure, severe&nbsp;irritation of the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach. May induce&nbsp;vomiting, diarrhea, severe dehydration and&nbsp;body fluid imbalance. Diquat itself has been found to cause liver and kidney damage, cataract, pupil dilation and severe skin allergies such as excessive rashes and burns. Exposure may trigger malaise, chest pain and even death.\nFishing is a multi-billion dollar industry in which Connecticut is losing tens of millions in revenue annually due to the detrimental affects herbicides have. The quality of fishing on bodies of water that have been treated with herbicides has declined drastically. To the point fishing license sales have fallen, local businesses have closed their doors, and fishing guides have seen a drop in clients.\nCandlewood Lake, notably one of the top bass fisheries in the country is thriving more than ever. It\u2019s the only lake we have that has not been treated. Needless to say it would be catastrophic to the fishery and the local economy if herbicides found their way in.\nThe main reason these herbicide treatments are occurring on public water bodies is that lake front property owners and non U.S. citizens do not want weeds near the docks they own or rent. There are several safe methods these individuals can use to achieve this. During winter drawdowns rubber mats can be installed to prevent vegetation from growing. Mechanical harvesting using machines is common throughout the country. Manual extraction by licensed aquatic landscapers is efficient and contributes to local economies. The list goes on and on.&nbsp;\nWith this petition we are calling on Connecticut legislators to once and for all propose and pass legislation creating a ban on the use of all chemical herbicides and pesticides on public bodies of water. These beautiful natural resources belong to all Connecticut residents, not only a few. We wish to keep these ecosystems healthy and flourishing for generations to come.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ii/mf/BDiimfWZgKRlSoZ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1602512451"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/sony-pictures-studios-dedicate-jeopardy-stage-at-sony-pictures-studios-to-alex-trebek?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Dedicate 'Jeopardy!'

His behavior is textbook and it is being reflected in our Nation\u2019s Capitol right now as GOP leaders demand that they be immediately forgiven and allowed to remain in positions of power despite their participation in creating the chaos that occurred on January 6th.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nI will not address Pastor Berger\u2019s claims that he was in DC for meetings before January 6th and that he did not attend the action at the Capitol because, after taking a look through his social media, I can see that he has, for many years, been involved directly with the Trump administration and no amount of backtracking after January 6th can erase this collaboration.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nIt is very telling to me that Steve Berger did not condemn white supremacy, Donald Trump, or fascism in his \u201capology\u201d. In fact, instead of actually apologizing for his role in supporting the fascist President, he decided to deflect, insisting that he is owed apologies for those who have attempted to slander him. He\u2019s also made claims that folks are making false allegations against him and that people haven\u2019t reached out to him before making statements. I personally know people who have been in contact with his office and have confirmed that he has refused to make a comment when they\u2019ve reached out. As many of us have seen since the beginning of the Trump administration, white supremacy has been the motivating factor for so much of Trump\u2019s supporter base. It is impossible to argue at this point that anyone can support Donald Trump and NOT support white supremacy.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nI am a strong believer in transformative justice and reconciliation. I myself was raised in the church, and understand the importance of truthful communication and the power of forgiveness. I understand that humans make mistakes, and that everyone should be given the opportunity to change and turn away from harmful&nbsp; actions. However, this requires ACTUAL repentence, not name calling, finger pointing, or lack of accountability. This is the motivating factor behind my demand that Pastor Steve Berger be removed from his position at Grace Chapel Church. I believe that his lack of self-accountability and his refusal to accept responsibility in supporting the Trump administration and promoting it in his church is not only unacceptable, it is dangerous. Donald Trump fomented insurrection at the Capitol that resulted in the deaths of 5 people. Pastor Steve Berger has condemned the \u201cviolent acts\u201d at the Capitol but has not condemned President Trump, at all and immediately after the event, made baseless claims trying to deflect responsibility from the real perpetrators.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nI feel it is is unhealthy for our community to have leaders in positions of power who refuse to take accountability for their actions. I believe a true leader and follower of Jesus Christ, would graciously admit to the entirety of his mistakes, not just pick and choose in order to make himself not seem culpable. I believe that someone who has such pull should openly admit that he has been promoting a white supremacist president, de-platform himself, and center the voices of those who have been harmed by the Trump administration and its supporters. We do not want community leaders who refuse to take responsibility and who shame those who ask for accountability. We ask for the resignation of Pastor Steve Berger and for Grace Chapel Church in Franklin, TN to publicly condemn his participation in the events of January 6th. We are in incredibly tension filled times, and now more than ever it is important to denounce fascism and white supremacy and ask those who refuse to denounce to be removed from positions of power.

However, Herrell is not new to undermining elections, as she previously attempted to impound legal absentee ballots in The 2018 Mid-Term Elections in the state of New Mexico.\nThrough her seditious behavior, lack of understanding of the United States Constitution, and unwavering support for an unstable and dangerous President, Herrell has proven that she does not possess the personal constitution to make reasonable and educated decisions for her State and its Citizens.&nbsp;Her repeated behavior is perilous to The State of New Mexico, The United States of America, and democracy itself.&nbsp;\nBy removing Rep.

The brand new superintendent of Padre Island National Seashore, a man who is not a scientist, has endorsed a Review that will gut and defund the Kemp's ridley sea turtle program run by Dr. Donna Shaver, a celebrated scientist.&nbsp;\nUnless the public speaks out now and demands this Review be withdrawn, the successful program that protects the Kemp's ridley sea turtle will be a remnant of what it is now.&nbsp; The two primary nesting locations for this most endangered of sea turtles are Padre Island National Seashore and a beach in Mexico. Reducing this program in Texas will reduce the Kemp's ridley population and put the entire species at even higher risk of extinction.Dr. Shaver was not invited to contribute to or even read the Review which will decimate the sea turtle program at Padre Island National Seashore. She is the foremost authority on the Kemp's ridley turtle and it is her sea turtle program. Instead, she was preemptively placed under a gag order not to comment before the Review was ever released. She may not be able to comment, but her whistle blower complaint says plenty. Dr. Shaver, who is celebrated worldwide, is sacrificing her career in an an effort to save these sea turtles.Here are a few of the damaging changes requested in the Review.The superintendent wants a 30% reduction in funding for the sea turtle program.\nThe superintendent wants to cut back the popular public hatchling release program which showcases Dr. Shaver's &amp; others' work saving the Kemp's ridley sea turtle and which brings in approximately one million dollars in annual tourist revenue to Corpus Christi, Texas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although all sea turtles are endangered, the superintendent wants all work to save other species of sea turtles at the park prohibited. If sea turtle eggs are not collected and protected at the Padre Island National Seashore, there is a 100% chance they will be destroyed. This ruling means any green sea turtle eggs or loggerhead sea turtle eggs laid at the beach will be left to be destroyed by vehicles, fire ants, or coyotes.&nbsp; Any cold-stunned or injured green or loggerhead turtles must be left in place, likely to die of predation or injury.&nbsp; After years of helping sea turtles, volunteers and scientists are being ordered to turn their backs and ignore them.Even though public comment was legally required for this Review, no public comment was requested or allowed. As you see, they even gagged the top scientist! This petition is our attempt to redress that and make a public comment.&nbsp; Members of the public fish, camp, and go birding at this national park. You have to drive on the beach for all of these activities. The proposed changes would either prohibit driving April 1 - July 15, or, at a minimum, require an additional permit fee on top of the park entrance fee. These proposals are in the report and acknowledge the state must be consulted.&nbsp; They are the argument for defunding the sea turtle program. The argument is wrong, but the argument is you can defund the program because there will be no driving on the beach.&nbsp;We believe in following the money to determine the reason behind this incomprehensible and destructive proposal. It appears the National Park Service would like to ban all traffic on the beach, ending camping and recreational fishing, and telling the public that nests on the beach are now safe, so they can reclaim the funds that were specifically granted for the turtle program and use those funds for other purposes. &nbsp;In fact, any nests left on the beach would not be safe.&nbsp; 100% would be predated by coyotes, fire ants, or other wildlife.&nbsp; Vehicles are only one of the threats to turtle nests. Banning traffic and dismantling the turtle program ends birding, fishing, and camping, as well as destroying endangered Kemp ridley sea turtles.\nHowever, under the original agreement between the state of Texas and the U.S. Government, if traffic is prohibited on the beach, the park will revert to the state. It may be that the National Park Service does not think Texas will try to reclaim the park land or perhaps the National Park Service no longer wants this park. In any event, if the park reverted to the state, it might no longer be a park, but might be developed.\nEither way, a way of life on Padre Island National Seashore is being threatened, not only for turtles, but also for tourists and residents.&nbsp;The sea turtles which nest at Padre Island National Seashore don't&nbsp; belong to the park or to Texas. They are protected by the National Park Service which should be stewards for them.&nbsp; In this case, the stewardship has failed, so contact your Senators and Representatives and object to this travesty.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, the final insult of the Review is this: \"research activities be removed from the Chief of the&nbsp;Division of Sea Turtle Science and Recovery and be placed under the direct control of a nonscientist, the park superintendent.\" That is right, take the scientific program away from control by scientists and give it to a career park employee who is an administrator, not a scientist.We demand this Review be withdrawn and any future Reviews be a collaboration with park scientists, as well as management, and that future Reviews be released for public comment, as is required by law,&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/ky/at/uikyATfmpLHQada-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607228194"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/westminster-locals-get-rafs-their-liquor-license-back?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Get Rafs their Liquor License Back", "description": "Rafs liquor license was suspended after a trial that was inadequately heard.

More than half of all American households own dogs, and according to The Harris Poll (2015), 96% of them consider them to be another member of the family. The loss of a dog, by death or theft, is an emotionally tolling experience that leaves families suffering.&nbsp;\nOn the other hand, it's not just families that suffer. Dogs are sentient beings, not inanimate objects. In a New York Times column, Gregory Berns, a neuroscientist and author, tells how he and his team used MRIs to decode the canine brain, with initial findings showing evidence that dogs empathize with humans, and are capable of experiencing positive emotions, like love and attachment.&nbsp;\nIt is estimated that around 2 million dogs are stolen each year in the US. Criminals are becoming more violent, attracted by the hefty rewards their heartbroken victims will offer to get back their canine family members. The weak dog theft laws that are in place in California are allowing criminals to operate with little accountability for their heinous acts, and are putting dog owners in danger.&nbsp;\nLet's ask the California State Legislature to pass dog theft laws that will reflect the irrecoverable damage done to all the victims, and that can serve as a deterrent for future crimes.

The BMI, originally known as the Quetelet Index, remains largely unchanged since its creation in the 1800s by a sociologist--not a medical doctor. It was intended to be used as a statistical tool to measure populations, not to diagnose health in individuals. Its creator, a Belgian named Adolphe Quetelet, sought to quantify \"the average man\" and enlisted only white, European men when developing his Index.&nbsp;\nThe resultant prescription of weight loss based on an individual's BMI is consistently met by severe resistance from the body which then launches a complex, multi-system effort to restore the lost weight over time. Ninety-eight percent of dieters will gain back all the weight they lost, and up to two-thirds of individuals will gain more weight over a period of three to five years. The evidence for this is as strong as the evidence that smoking causes cancer (level A). Additionally, there is evidence that an \"obesity paradox\" exists in which patients living with a growing list of chronic diseases who have higher percentages of body fat live longer than their thinner counterparts.&nbsp;\nDue to the BMI's racist and patriarchal roots, Black and brown women are most disproportionately affected.&nbsp; This contributes to systemic weight-based discrimination and increases morbidity and mortality rates among people of color.

They further claim that they \"communicate openly, honestly, and reliably\", and that they provide \"access to timely and reliable information on decisions and performance\".\nI ask you to join me in asking EBRPD to honor their own values. &nbsp;\nWhere was their empathy when they sent rangers out with guns?\nWhere was the teamwork they cultivate with their colleagues and partners when they carried this out without consulting with a single shelter or rescue group? &nbsp;\nHow can they claim that they communicate openly and honestly with the public they serve when they (separately and on more than one occasion) told Cecelia and another colony caretaker that they had not killed the cats, but had taken them to shelters in Oakland and Dublin? &nbsp;Most of the colony cats were not only spayed, neutered and vaccinated - they were also microchipped by Fix Our Ferals. &nbsp;Had even a single one arrived alive at any shelter or veterinary hospital, they would have immediately been scanned for chips, and the organization would have been notified. &nbsp;Even knowing that to be true, Cecelia and the other caretaker held out hope and spoke with both shelters. &nbsp;Needless to say, neither had received any cats from EBRPD. &nbsp;As Oakland Animal Services' Director Ann Dunn made clear when interviewed by ABC7, she wasn't even aware of the cats because EBRPD never consulted with OAS or any other shelter or rescue group.\nIf EBRPD truly provides access to timely and reliable information on their decisions, why is it that they still haven't supplied any records documenting any of the killings, carried out on multiple&nbsp;occasions, in multiple parts of the district, even though ABC7's team filed a California Public Records Act request for these documents?\nMatt Graul, EBRPD's Chief of Stewardship, claims that he and his staff \"feel horrible about this\" and that they \"really don't want to ever have to take this step\". &nbsp;Perhaps it was as OAS Director Ann Dunn said, and EBRPD were unaware that Oakland Animal Services were a resource. &nbsp;Perhaps they were also unaware of FAAS (Friends of the Alameda Animal Shelter), and they didn't know about ICRA (Island Cat Resources and Adoption). &nbsp;None were ever contacted by EBRPD, and all three organizations immediately pledged to help when they were made aware of what EBRPD was doing. &nbsp;Assuming that park officials truly felt horrible, assuming they truly saw no other way, assuming they had the best of intentions but simply didn't know that they had allies and options -- assuming all that to be true, then why did they tell Dan Noyes that they would not pledge to stop shooting cats?\nAgain, I hope you will join me in asking East Bay Regional Park District to honor their own values. &nbsp;I have never met Cecelia, but several months ago, she humanely trapped two cats and their two kittens. &nbsp;The adult male was neutered, the adult female was spayed; they were both vaccinated and microchipped and returned to their colony. &nbsp;The two kittens ended up being fostered&nbsp;by me. &nbsp;It is their photo that is attached to this petition. &nbsp;They have since been adopted together into a loving home, where they are providing comfort and joy to a family and their sixteen-year-old cat who were all grieving the recent loss of their other senior cat. &nbsp;Those kittens' parents were shot and killed by EBRPD. &nbsp;When I was made aware of what had happened, I will admit I was extraordinarily angry; I was deeply disappointed in EBRPD, and I was truly heartbroken. &nbsp;Just as Ann Dunn said, I too am still heartbroken \"just knowing that there's no reason (these shootings) needed to happen\". &nbsp;I am still heartbroken, but more than anything I am very determined to do what I can to ensure that this doesn't happen again. &nbsp;Please sign my petition and ask EBRPD to work with all the rescue groups and individuals who have stepped up and offered their help and their resources. &nbsp;Please ask them to pledge to stop shooting cats.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/bj/iu/bFbJIuMbxNvoCwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607343194"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/broken-arrow-city-council-masking-in-broken-arrow-ok?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Masking in Broken Arrow OK", "description": "The Broken Arrow City Council must take additional steps to protect our community from Covid-19.

The B.1.17 mutated strain of the virus has been discovered in the United States. It has resulted in an extreme lock down in Great Britain.\nThe White House SARS-CoV-2 Task Force, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institutes for Health, in addition to local and state health departments and physicians, all consistently produce figures from quantitative scientific research, showing measurable effects of mask-wearing in cities. The results of this research prove that wearing masks does indeed slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The current lack of a policy is a failure to protect citizens, particularly those who must work in the public and risk exposure to the airborne virus from an unmasked pubic repeatedly throughout the day. Every statistic on transmission in Broken Arrow has risen to extraordinary levels. Nearly any added emphasis on mask wearing would be an improvement.\n\nWe support a mask ordinance to help schools and businesses remain open both, deserve our support.&nbsp;\nWe support a city-wide mask ordinance because Broken Arrow is not an \u201cisland\u201d within the Greater Tulsa area, and the infectious climate here contributes to area hospitals and ICU units being overwhelmed and medical personnel being taxed to a breaking point. If the contagion gets worse what we do now can prevent the eventual collapse of our health system.\nWe support a city-wide mask ordinance because the first goal of any level of effective government is the protection of the community it is called to govern.\nWe support a mask ordinance because, the unequivocal support of city leaders to this basic public health strategy is important to encourage mask wearing.\nWe support a city-wide mask mandate because our masks protect you, and your masks will protect us. The higher the percentage of people wearing masks, the lower the rate of spreading the infection.We support a mask ordinance because endangering the health and lives of others by refusing to wear a mask is not the Oklahoma Standard of caring for and helping one another.\n", "image_url": "https://static.change.org/profile-img/default-user-profile.svg"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/wadsworth-police-department-help-bring-my-brother-iron-cannon-home-been-missing-since-october-17-2020?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Help bring my brother Iron Cannon home been missing since October 17, 2020", "description": "I AM ASKING FOR A DEMAND ON BRINGING MY BROTHER HOME AND FOR JUSTICE TO BE SERVED.\nWE HAVE BEEN WAITING WAY TO LONG FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO BE DONE AND CLOSER FOR THE FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY AS WELL.\nTHE POLICE DIDN'T GET INVOLVED UNTIL 2 WEEKS AFTER IRON CANNON WAS REPORTED MISSING.

Throughout the country high school sports associations have collaborated with state officials to offer student-athletes opportunities to engage in the extracurricular activities they love, and have trained for throughout their high school years. Those collaborations have allowed students to hold on to some semblance of normalcy during the most chaotic period of their young adult lives. Everywhere except Illinois.&nbsp;\nIn Illinois, Illinois High School Association officials and members of the Illinois Department of Public Health and Governor J.B. Pritzker's office has all shown immense failures in leadership. Mistakes and miscalculations have led to petty bickering through the press and failed to produce a cohesive plan, all while harming student-athletes that mitigations and&nbsp; guidance is \u201csupposedly enacted to protect\u201d. While the past cannot be rewritten or regrets undone, there is still time left in the 2020-21 school year to provide student-athletes meaningful extracurricular experiences. Those who have signed and publicized this petition, coaches, players, parents, and supporters would request the IHSA, IDPH and JB Pritzker to do the following:&nbsp;\nPublicly apologize through a joint statement to student- athletes throughout the state of Illinois for the mismanagement of this situation. At the bare minimum, the lack of consistent communication and a cohesive plan had created an unnecessary atmosphere of anxiety, depression and fear, that is not a result of COVID-19, but a failure in leadership.&nbsp;\n\nEstablish a set of safety mitigations, specific to each offered activity through the IHSA, that will protect student-athletes, coaches, parents, officials, and event workers to the best of your ability.&nbsp;Revise and publish a new calendar of extracurricular activities grounded in the following principles:\nAssign all sports, regardless of their traditional season assignment (fall, winter, or spring), to a time in the calendar that gives each of them the best opportunity to be conducted in a safe and meaningful manner.&nbsp;\nProvide all students with an opportunity to participate in at least one sport during this school year, even if sports conflict with one another.

Despite initially being offered a plea deal, Greg maintained his innocence the entire time. He has now been in prison for 39 years.\nMy life has been shaped by my uncle\u2019s incarceration. Uncle Greg missed my birth, but when I was four, my parents moved to Westchester, NY so we could be closer to where he was imprisoned. I\u2019ve felt his absence in every milestone of my life since then. He missed my graduations from high school and Harvard. He could not be there on my wedding day.&nbsp;\nAnd for what? There was no physical evidence in the case against Greg, and his court-appointed defense lawyer failed to present an alibi witness who had agreed to testify on his behalf. Only a Black man in New York in the 1980s could have been convicted on such thin allegations and sent away for so long.\nThe average time served in state prison for a murder conviction is 15 years. Greg\u2019s sentence of 50 years to life is staggering; what some refer to as \u201cdeath by incarceration.\u201d\nUncle Greg grew up in a system rife with injustice. Just five months after sentencing Greg, Queens Supreme Court Justice Thomas Agresta used the N-word in open court in reference to a Black defendant. His gross, public ethical violation was so egregious that Justice Agresta was censured a year later, and has since been used as an example in legal scholarship on judicial misconduct and community harm.&nbsp;\nGreg is an inspiration to me and countless people who have crossed paths with him. In the past 39 years, he has taken every opportunity to improve himself and help others. He has served as a peer counselor, legal research instructor, and led numerous workshops on aggression replacement training and domestic violence prevention. He\u2019s also completed college-level courses that transformed his world view and fueled his aspirations for the future.\nEvery day I worry for my uncle.&nbsp;Uncle Greg isn\u2019t eligible for parole for another 11 years. His innocence is known by his family, his supporters and his legal team. It will be proven in a court of law one day. But until that day comes, nothing is more important than this: Greg Mingo needs to come home.\nInspired by my uncle\u2019s story, CUNY law students are assisting Greg with filing a clemency application, calling on Governor Cuomo to show compassion for Greg and release him from prison.&nbsp;\nHow You Can Help\nGreg Mingo\u2019s family and supporters have set up this petition to gather signatures to advocate for his clemency. Please add your name (and address if you live in New York) to call for his release. For more info on how to get involved, please email info@freegregmingo.com or go to freegregmingo.com.\n* Please note: Including your address with your name\u2014especially authentic New York State addresses\u2014is a HUGE help.

Cuomo, it will boost Greg\u2019s chances of freedom.\nI sincerely thank you for taking the time to learn about someone who means so much to my family.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/qj/ff/DmQjfFiaIERjnMd-800x450-noPad.jpg?1603145343"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/department-of-justice-demand-doj-charge-insurrectionist-with-murder-of-capitol-police?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Demand DOJ charge insurrectionist with Murder of Capitol Police", "description": "We demand that the people who entered the Capitol building on 1/7/2021 be charged under the felony murder rule, as while insurrectionist were looting and sabotaging the Capitol building a Capitol police officer was killed.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/hl/rc/BkHlrcOGzyULnld-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610136095"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/josh-hawley-and-the-us-senate-josh-hawley-must-resign-or-be-expelled?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Josh Hawley must resign or be expelled", "description": "Josh Hawley is a primary reason for the attempted coup on the United States Capital.

All the subtle spice notes, the crunch and airy texture you can only find with a Lay's Potato Chip, it was truly a match made in heaven.

This event is considered to be an act of domestic terrorism that challenged the ability of our federal government to function properly and threatened our national security.&nbsp;\nAccording to policy code 2220 of the Lee County School Board of Education, public officials are to conduct themselves to higher standards than non-elected officials. They are to remember that their public actions are not just a reflection of themselves but of the board, the school district, and the county. Board member Womack's intentional public sharing of her participation in seditious acts against the federal government does NOT reflect the board, school district, or county in a positive light.&nbsp;\nBy willfully posting evidence of her approval of the Capitol takeover, Womack has aligned herself with acts of terrorism. This is unpatriotic and dangerous as it reflects Lee County's schools and citizens. We, the voters and residents of Lee County believe that Womack should resign immediately and should be replaced by a member who can more effectively represent the interests of Lee County as a diverse community and uphold the sovereignty of the federal government.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/zf/xd/NrZfxDzMEdaCRKd-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610470765"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/donald-j-trump-bring-kash-lee-kelly-home-we-all-need-him?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Bring Kash Lee Kelly home.

She also does not believe in masks in her class and this makes Lassiter look awful and white dominated and racist. She should not keep her job. Mrs. Doemel has had many racist facebook posts. She got fired for them for a semester, then was welcomed back this semester. She recently told an anonymous student she attended the raid at the capital and said it was \u201cVery fun\u201d. She also refuses to wear her mask while teaching as she believes she is \u201cImmune to Covid-19\u201d. She brags about her political opinions and going to rallies. There have also been students that are POCs that have said they feel \u201cuneasy\u201d around her because of her old racist comments and racist facebook remarks. We truly don\u2019t think any student should feel that their teacher is out to get them because of their skincolor. Certain parents and most students do not feel comfortable in the environment Mrs. Doemel has been teaching in.

local community may be unable to prevent development, that will be detrimental to the area, nearly all residents in the&nbsp;surrounding neighborhoods are completely opposed to the addition of multi-family housing that will cause traffic and safety problems, create even more problems with schools that are already over capacity, already over destroyed wildlife habitat, and potentially lower the property values of the existing community.&nbsp;\nThe traffic surge during morning rush hours will negatively impact safety for children since students walk to school in the mornings.&nbsp; In general, the area traffic is continuing to increase, and heavy traffic is already common on Limona Road and Victoria Street during work and school hours.&nbsp; Additionally, there has been two fatal car accidents on the north and south side of the railroad tracks and&nbsp;one student walking in the crosswalk at Meade Street and Victoria Street.\nSchools and daycares in the area are already reported at overcapacity, and the county should not approve multi-family dwelling that creates or exacerbates a situation that will cause school concurrency to fail for this proposal and/ or other approved plans.\nWildlife has been observed in the area and any development will destroy their habitat.&nbsp; Any planned development of the property should consider the continuing impact to local wildlife habitat.&nbsp; Coyotes sightings have become normal circumstance within our neighborhoods at all times of the day and threaten the safety of children and household pets.&nbsp; There have been recorded attacks and sighting at local schools as recently as today, January 12, 2021 at Brandon High School at 1:00 PM.&nbsp;\nProperty values are likely to go down in the area if multi-family apartments or condominiums are built.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multi-family dwellings are inconsistent with the neighborhoods developed in this area.&nbsp;\nI urge you to disapprove the proposed zoning and recent

They were able to receive my Snapchat password, and they locked me out of my account. They had access to all of my \u201cMemories,\u201d a feature Snapchat encourages its users to utilize to store content, and therefore access to personal images, screenshots, and most pictures that I have taken on Snapchat in the past few years. The hacker then sent messages to my friends telling them to tell me to talk to them from a new account.\nThe hacker then continued to threaten me and provide ultimatums. Give them my \u201cMy Eyes Only\u201d password and they would give me my Recovery Code, they would not hack my friends, they would not post images on my Public Story, they would not post my images on a Revenge P*rn website, etc..\nMy \u201cMy Eyes Only\u201d included sensitive, explicit, and most of all personal content, so I did not give them the password. They then proceeded to post semi-nude images of me from my \u201cMemories\u201d on my Public Snapchat Story, and I do not know what they did with any of the other images, whether they are saved to their phone and shared with their friends or posted publicly on the Internet.\nI acknowledge that this is Sexual Harassment and Cyberbullying. In some photos, I am under the age of 18, which borders Child P*rnography.\nI filed out the Snapchat Report form right as they sent me the first threat, asking for access back to my account or for the account to be deleted. Almost 12 hours later, I have received no reply. There is no helpline to call and nothing I can do. I have filed a police report, but that too is to no avail in these complicated and tricky times.\nEvery time I changed the password, they changed it back. They set up a new Two-Factor Authentication and refuse to give me the Recovery Code. They have access to all my personal content, and I feel violated and helpless.\nSUMMARY:\nSnapchat is a growing social media platform catering internationally to people as young as 13. With new features like \u201cMemories\u201d and \u201cMy Eyes Only,\u201d introduced, many users store private and personal information, images, and more under the impression that it is safe.\nAlthough there are new protective features Snapchat has implemented, such as Two-Factor Authentication, accounts still continue to get compromised - thus private information and content is compromised, which can be unsafe, especially for minors. Snapchat does not have any sort of widely-known 24-hour helpline and does not provide a time frame for responding to filed reports through their Support platform.\nIn the case that an account is compromised or hacked into, or in the case of some Emergency, there should exist a way to quickly delete said account.\nThis may present itself as a 24-hour callable helpline, an Emergency report form that will be responded to within a few hours, or something else. This platform should be available remotely and accessible to someone who does not have their phone.\nGOAL:\nI hope to protect future Snapchat users, especially minors who might not know of additional authentication features, by pushing Snapchat to create a way for users to Delete a Compromised Account in case of Emergency or a special scenario like mine. I wish that everyone\u2019s personal content within the application is protected. The same way a credit card can be canceled if it falls into the wrong hands, a Snapchat account should be able to be quickly deleted should it do the same.\nThank you for your time and support!\n**I also think that Recovery Codes and Authentication Features should be more widely publicized.**", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/9/wi/ix/LSwIIxBxRiAAkjB-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610794939"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/united-states-department-of-transportation-reverse-the-dot-ban-on-emotional-support-animals-on-us-flights?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Reverse the DOT Ban on Emotional Support Animals on US Flights!", "description": "Thousands of people have emotional support animals that help them during short and long flights every year.

The canal is very pleasant to walk alongside and I couldn\u2019t imagine it being encased in a pipeline. We all love the canal, despite the few flooding issues. The homeowners have found solutions in the past to defend their properties against flooding damage. These solutions can be expounded upon without use of a pipeline.\nOn top of it being a beautiful part of the scenery, it is also a supplementary water source for birds, ducks, and small critters.The concerns listed in the proposal do not seem valid or urgent to me. As a resident of the area, I have spoke to the homeowners on the canal and they have expressed a desire to maintain the canal as is. In spite of the occasional flooding, we all still love the canal and want to solve problems without the use of a pipe. I have walked alongside the canal during rainstorms when water levels were high and the canal was able to accommodate. Improvements can be made to endure even more water if needed.\nWater conservation is listed as one of the concerns for this project as well. I do not see how a pipeline would be necessary for conservation seeing as how the canal can be managed just perfectly as is. However, I am not opposed to the construction/ improvement of the SCIC diversion structure or the headgate structures.\nFor full project proposal visit http://www.truckeeriver.nvwatershed.com\nPlease share your concerns by emailing truckeeriver@nvwatershed.com, sharing and signing this petition, and telling others in your community!!!

Between the months of April 2019 and December 2019 Sabrina made many pleas for police intervention, filed an Order of Protection and an Intimidation Report, and repeatedly told officers that her life was at risk, yet the Memphis Police Department failed her, as they historically have when dealing with racial-minority women who live in underserved communities experiencing domestic violence. Sabrina took all of the right steps and was promised protection, yet officers continuously showed her a different level of care than they statistically have shown to white women or women with higher socio-economic status who have experienced domestic violence. The choices made by officers here directly led to the death of Sabrina Nguyen.\nSABRINA\u2019S LAST CALLS FOR HELP&nbsp;The Memphis Police Department was first made aware of the violence Sabrina was experiencing in April of 2019 when Sabrina was assaulted while moving out of her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home. In June, Sabrina was once again assaulted by her ex-boyfriend and officers took him into custody while Sabrina went through the process of having an Order of Protection put in place against him, which she was told would prevent any contact between the two. In August, Sabrina was kidnapped and assaulted by her ex-boyfriend. In September, Sabrina\u2019s ex-boyfriend stalked her home and attempted to break in.&nbsp;In December, 911 calls were made by Sabrina on at least 11 separate occasions. Sabrina filed assault charges on December 10th after being kidnapped and assaulted by her ex-boyfriend which led to his arrest on the same day. He bonded out on December 11th and by December 14th, Sabrina was already receiving more haunting phone calls from him. He was arrested again on December 17th and posted bond on December 18th. On December 19th he kidnapped Sabrina and pulled a knife on her.&nbsp;On December 20th he kidnapped Sabrina again and drove her across multiple states until finally dropping her off at the Memphis Police Department on December 23rd. Sabrina made officers aware on the 23rd that her ex-boyfriend had stolen her vehicle and she called MPD repeatedly in the days after the incident to check on the progress they had made in getting her vehicle back. A warrant was finally, after 6 days, issued for the theft of Sabrina\u2019s vehicle, but officers did not make any documented attempt to make an arrest or get Sabrina\u2019s vehicle back between the time of the warrant being issued and Sabrina\u2019s death.&nbsp;On January 1st, 2020 Sabrina\u2019s brother reported Sabrina as a missing person and provided officers with the address of Sabrina\u2019s ex-boyfriend. On January 2nd, 2020 officers found Sabrina\u2019s dead body lying on a sidewalk near a busy intersection. According to an affidavit, \u201c[t]he Scene Officer recognized [the body to be that of] Sabrina Nguyen from multiple incidents involving her ex-boyfriend.\u201d&nbsp;Sabrina\u2019s ex-boyfriend kidnapped and assaulted her on multiple occasions, made terroristic threats towards her, stole her vehicle, violated bail conditions, and stalked her. He was arrested twice and had 8 formal charges brought against him in the month of December alone. Officers knew where he lived and had arrested him at that location previously. Officers knew that Sabrina desperately needed her vehicle in order to work and to get away from dangerous situations. Despite all of this information, officers chose not to act between December 23rd and January 1st and that choice led to their finding of Sabrina\u2019s dead body on January 2nd. Officers were given countless signs that should have led them to make different choices, choices that would have saved Sabrina, yet due to her gender, race and position in society, they made decisions that led to her death instead.&nbsp;WHY WE MUST DEMAND CHANGE&nbsp;Officers across the nation continuously fail to acknowledge diversity when handling situations of domestic violence. Women as a whole are more vulnerable to experiencing domestic violence and women of color are the most likely demographic to experience domestic violence while simultaneously being the most disproportionately affected by homicides resulting from intimate-partner-violence. It is well known that social position and economic status also play a huge part in resources and services made available to individuals and that stands true in situations of domestic violence as well.&nbsp;Even if officers were offering the exact same level of protection to these racial-minority women in underserved communities as they were to their white, well-off counterparts, they would not be taking into consideration the fact that many of these techniques and services would be ineffective to this population of women because of the unique nature of their experiences with domestic violence. Officers must be held accountable in situations like Sabrina\u2019s wherein they choose to ignore the seriousness of the situation and make decisions that lead to deaths that could easily have been prevented.&nbsp;The actions suggested below are some of the changes which we believe would have saved Sabrina Nguyen if implemented by the Memphis Police Department, and if implemented across the United States, will function to protect many more women like Sabrina in the future.&nbsp;1. Notification systems must be put in place which automatically notify domestic violence victims when their arrested aggressor becomes eligible to post bond or is released.&nbsp;2. Police officers must be required to have higher levels of training in preventative and intervening measures which require the consideration of societal factors such as gender, race, and socio-economic status that make violence more likely to occur or more likely to result in death within certain populations.&nbsp;3. Police departments must be required to create and keep an up-to-date database for domestic-abuse related incidents and information which would allow officers and 911-operators to be automatically made aware of any history or patterns of domestic violence when searching someone\u2019s name in the department\u2019s already-existing system.&nbsp;4. Demand transparency of police departments by requiring a yearly public report detailing the funds spent and measures taken to prevent further predictable deaths of women of color in underserved communities who experience domestic violence. This report should also provide yearly statistics of domestic violence in that department\u2019s jurisdiction and the deaths resulting from such instances which can be broken down by race, gender, and socio-economic status.&nbsp;5. Demand that officers have ongoing education and training of the unique realities, difficulties, and needs of racial-minority women in underserved communities experiencing domestic assault.&nbsp;6. Demand the creation of programs that are catered towards racial-minority women in underserved communities which allows them to report domestic violence to non-police officers and provides them with resources and services that allow them to safely get away from their aggressor even if they are fearful of having police involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you or anyone you know is experiencing domestic violence, please reach out for help. The National Domestic Violence Hotline can be called 24 hours a day at 1(800) 799-7233 and their website, thehotline.org, provides contact information for local resources in all 50 states.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/xt/oi/omxtoIPqZJqRMnZ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609779759"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/tennessee-general-assembly-save-persons-with-intellectual-disabilities-from-execution-in-tennessee?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Save Persons with Intellectual Disabilities from Execution in Tennessee.", "description": "Both the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 and the Tennessee Supreme Court in 2001 have ruled that a person with an intellectual disability should not be executed.

She was a dynamic leader rising in power from becoming Mississippi\u2019s former Director of Human and Cultural Needs and a member of the Canton Municipal School Board.\nMs. Rainey was indicted on charges for a voter fraud conspiracy based on the false police report of a witness who claimed that Courtney paid her to vote. Courtney confronted Ousley, a woman she had known most of her life, and asked her to go back and tell the truth. During Courtney\u2019s trial, the witness admitted to lying about Courtney paying for her vote. She testified that she lied because she was afraid of the police. &nbsp;She also said that she was never intimidated by Courtney.\nHowever, according to the state, Ms. Rainey's actions still constituted intimidation, even if the witness admitted to lying and testified that she was never intimidated by Courtney. For this reason, Although she was not convicted for the voter fraud charge, she was convicted for witness intimidation. She was sentenced to 15 years, the maximum sentence for witness intimidation.\nCourtney Rainey\u2019s story is another painful example of the ills of this criminal legal system.

The historic American Can Company buildings (now called American Tin Cannery, or ATC) located at the entrance to Pacific Grove, California would be largely demolished and all 79 healthy, mature, trees would be removed including 52 supposedly protected Monterey Cypress trees.&nbsp; The project proposes 347,376 square feet of three-story and four-story buildings, with 2 separate hotel structures, entrances and lobbies, 2 swimming pools, retail space, and 260 underground valet parking spaces excavated out of solid granite, plus 44 street-level valet spaces off Central Ave.\nWHY SHOULD YOU CARE?\nHarbor Seals pups threatened.&nbsp; Our community takes pride in the fact the beaches across the street from the proposed American Tin Cannery Hotel have provided safe space for Harbor Seals to haul out and to raise pups.&nbsp; Noise pollution and underground drilling &amp; excavation vibrations are expected to significantly stress the Harbor Seals, which are known to be very sensitive to even normal construction noise.&nbsp; The granite is so hard and dense that conventional excavation methods cannot be used.&nbsp; Construction is estimated to last two years, with demolition of the reinforced concrete buildings and excavation of granite bedrock lasting an estimated 2 and 1/2 months, including removal of over 6,500 truckloads of granite, building debris, and pavement.&nbsp; Serious impacts on the seals have NOT been adequately addressed by the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR).\nExtreme tree removal.&nbsp; The proposed ATC hotel project is so massive that it requires the removal of 79 trees (including \u201cprotected\u201d Monterey Cypresses), which comprise the entire tree population of the property.&nbsp;

Armenians are struggling to live and defend their independent democratic Republic of NK/Artsakh. This right to self-determination was granted to all autonomous regions belonging to the former Soviet Union after the USSR collapsed; however, the Republic of NK / Artsakh continues to be denied the same liberty.&nbsp;\nWe demand to\n1) &nbsp;RECOGNIZE the democratic indigenous Armenian state, Republic of NK/Artsakh.2) &nbsp;STOP the Azeri and Turkish dictatorship.&nbsp;3) &nbsp;HOLD Azerbaijan and Turkey accountable for committing genocides &amp; other crimes against humanity that violate the established UN\u2019s Declaration of Human Rights\nI. We call on&nbsp;the Geneva Convention&nbsp;to hold the government of Azerbaijan responsible for committing acts of genocide and other violations against Armenian soldiers and civilians in NK/ Artsakh and levy strict economic sanctions on Azerbaijan for:\n1) The use of Cluster bombs on Armenian citizens and war zones.\nOn September 27, 2020, the Azeri army broke the Peace Agreement of 1994 between the two nations, Azerbaijan, and the Republic of NK/Artsakh. The Azerbaijani government used banned cluster bombs to attack residential areas in NK inhibited by native Armenians at 7 am. The use of cluster bombs violates the Geneva Conventions, also known as The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) of 2008 prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of cluster munitions in war zones, particularly in regions largely occupied by civilians.\n2) The use of white phosphorous munitions containing chemical weapons in the war zone &amp; the region.\nOn Oct 30, 2020, Azeri military forces engaged in the use of white phosphorus munitions, in the region of NK/Artsakh. The use of chemical weapons grossly violates the following laws: the International Humanitarian Law, principles of Customary Law, Geneva Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention, Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Technique, and the provisions of the relevant UN conventions and documents.\n3) The Azerbaijani government\u2019s unprecedented treatment of prisoners during the recent war in NK/Artsakh which by far exceeds the level of cruelty that the Nazis practiced during the WWII crimes. It is further noted that this treatment continues to persist despite the signing of a treaty agreement.&nbsp;\nII. We call on the&nbsp;UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the UN Council to&nbsp;recognize the independent Republic of NK/Artsakh&nbsp;and&nbsp;to hold the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments accountable for the systematic violations of human rights. We also call for both governments to be held accountable for the ongoing extermination of Armenians and their culture, which occurred during Azerbaijan\u2019s recent violation of the 1994 Peace Agreement in tandem with the overt support of Turkey on September 27, 2020.\nIn accordance with UN Convention, the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that states:\n\u201c\u2026Article I\nThe Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.\nArticle II\nIn the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\n(a) Killing members of the group;\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.&nbsp;\nArticle III\nThe following acts shall be punishable:\n(a) Genocide;\n(b) Conspiracy to commit genocide;\n(c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide;\n(d) Attempt to commit genocide;&nbsp;\n(e) Complicity in genocide;\nArticle IV\nPersons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals\u2026\u201d\n1) WE demand to recognize sovereignty and independence of the Republic of NK/Artsakh and STOP the Azerbaijani and Turkish government\u2019s dictatorship in this region.\nThe recognition of the Republic of NK/Artsakh\u2019s sovereignty is the only way to build peace and to stop the genocide occurring in this region. The formal recognition of this region will save many generations from experiencing collective pain and intergenerational trauma. The systemic extermination of the Armenians and Armenian culture, in addition to the false representation of historical facts, violates the integrity of the region and creates trauma that will be passed on to 14 generations.&nbsp;\nWe must prevent the current and future generations from experiencing further trauma.&nbsp;\nThe Republic of NK/Artsakh has been governed by democratic principles for several decades since its independence from the Soviet regime.&nbsp;\nThe Azerbaijani and Turkish governments engage in acts that violate the human rights of their own citizens, thus openly violating the UN Declaration of Human Rights.&nbsp;\n2) To hold the Azerbaijani government responsible for committing genocidal acts against Native Armenians, other crimes against humanity, and obstructing justice by manipulating and practicing revisionism &amp; denialism!\nArmenians in NK/ Artsakh experienced systematic oppression and violation of fundamental human rights due to Azeri oppression. The marginalization and sub-humanization of Armenian people in NK/ Artsakh region is a norm in Azeri culture. The Azerbaijani government justifies, manipulates, blames, and perpetuates the horrors of genocide by committing murder, and organizing pogroms.&nbsp;The recent war in NK/Artsakh is essentially the next step in the Azerbaijani plan to erase the Armenian nation and its culture from the region.&nbsp;\nFor decades, including the years during the Soviet Union, the Azerbaijani government periodically committed acts of genocide and cultural cleansing of Armenians in NK/ Artsakh. For example, the Nakhichevan region was inhabited by Armenians for thousands of years and yet every Armenian family was forced to flee to save their lives. At present day, there are no Armenians living in this region. Later, was the Sumgait genocide of Armenians in 1988, followed by the genocide of Armenians in Kirovabad (Ganja). Thereafter, there were Armenian pogroms in Baku in the 90s, followed by the Karabakh war of 1994, and the current violation of the peace agreement that the Azerbaijani government signed with the government of Republic NK/Artsakh in 1994. On September 27, 2020, the Azerbaijani military used banned cluster bombs on peacefully sleeping Armenian civilians. They also used white phosphorous chemical weapons in the war zone and forests where people found refuge from the bombing. In addition, Azerbaijan engaged in the deliberate destructions of infrastructures, including hospitals, schools, churches and historical Armenian heritage buildings / monuments in the region both during and after the war. These are a short list of examples of the brutalities inflicted on the Armenian people and their culture in NK/ Artsakh.\nDenialism is the primary technique that the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments use to justify and conceal their crimes against humanity.&nbsp;The promotion of hate speech and Armenophobia in multimedia and press is very common in both countries. Moreover, the economic and political suppression and isolation of Armenians in the region has forced thousands of Armenians to flee from their homeland. These acts are strategically practiced by both governments in order to manipulate and falsify cultural and historical facts in the region, including but not limited to the destruction of Armenian ancient heritage. For example, the largest ancient Armenian cemetery in the world, Julfa, that was protected by UNESCO has been destroyed by Azeris. They also have rewritten the ancient scripts and altered ancient maps of the region. They created false accusations and fabricated stories about Armenian occupation of the land with fake documents and manufactured sources. These are a short list of examples reflecting acts of cultural genocide committed by the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments to actively pursue the annihilation of the Armenian people and their history in NK/ Artsakh that dates back 2600 years. The Azerbaijani and Turkish government\u2019s attempts to fabricate a new history of the NK/ Artsakh region and annihilation of the Armenian culture is an insult on the world\u2019s conscience. A recent exhibit of the Armenian heritage organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC, displayed multiple ancient artifacts and historical facts of the rightful existence of indigenous Armenian civilization in the Caucus region including the NK/Artsakh region for thousands of years.&nbsp;\nThe Azerbaijani government with open support of the Turkish government, continues to commit unprecedented levels of violations against humanity by systematically exterminating the indigenous Armenian people and their culture. They falsely claim NK/ Artsakh land, heritage, and history as their own!&nbsp;\nWE the undersigned in this petition demand the UN recognize the Azerbaijani\u2019s genocide of Armenians in NK/Artsakh that has lasted for decades!&nbsp; We must STOP the BARBARIAN PRACTICES in 21st&nbsp; century and STAND UP for humanity!\nWe choose to follow the three pillars of the American Founding Fathers JUSTICE, PEACE, and DEMOCRACY.\nWithout Justice, it is impossible to establish Peace and without Peace, Democracy cannot be nourished.

But I write to you today with passion and fear that we as HUMANS are failing our fellow man. First of all, I don\u2019t defend the actions of criminals-never have, never will. If we are truly to support and uphold the tenet of \u201cLiberty and Justice for All\u201d then we have to do better.\nIF the justice system is designed to exonerate the innocent and punish the guilty:\nWhy would we lock up men who served their time in full?Why would we lock up men for what they MIGHT do in the future?Why would we lock up men with no definitive release date?Why would we target one offense to lock up potential future crimes?Why would we make men pay for and wear ankle bracelets in a locked facility?Why would we charge men 33% of all income and gifts (on top of paid taxes)?Why would we increase a multi-million dollar budget by 63% in just a few years and see no increase in the quality of care or release through rehabilitation?Why would we call a prison a center for treatment (locked doors, razor wire, ankle monitors, etc.)?Why would we only let them outside an hour a day if they are \u201cresidents\u201d of treatment?Why would we only release a handful in half a decade?Why would we let a business profit from incarceration?Why would we let a business profit for NOT releasing \u201cresidents\u201d?Why would we allow ONE person to decide if someone needed treatment? Even parole has a board of people to review release.Why would we move from outpatient care of productive working citizens that had served their time and were attending regular therapy for treatment to an inpatient facility (prison with another name) with no clear path for release in a FOR PROFIT shadow prison?In Littlefield, Texas there is a FOR PROFIT prison holding men that served their time, or residents as the state would say, for crimes they MIGHT commit after they have served their full sentence. Justice, you say. I say business for mass incarceration. I say a failed idea when treatment is so inconsistent because of staff turnover and the deliberate reluctance to release because a company can\u2019t make money off empty beds.\nWe should be ashamed. People should know.\nReframe your thinking. You get two speeding tickets. Now the state has decided that you will speed again. It is just a matter of time. The state revokes your license, makes you wear and pay for a monitor, and you have to keep paying the fine every month. You attend defensive driving, at your own expense, weekly, but you can\u2019t pass the class. The instructor changes weekly and doesn\u2019t know how well you did in the prior weekends. You cry \u201cwolf\u201d, but no one listens. Your just a poor guy in a little known, small Texas town. You can\u2019t afford good counsel, but you know it\u2019s wrong. Why would we do this to you? To anyone? You paid your fine, you attended the class, your insurance went up, but you might, you just might do it all again.\nI don\u2019t care who you are. Justice is justice. If you punish me for something I did and I take that punishment, then justice was served. If the legal system is designed to correct wrongs, why would we punish indefinitely? How can we punish indefinitely? Where\u2019s the justice? Where is the chance for redemption? You tell me. You tell me.\nThe Texas Civil Commitment Center is a FOR-PROFIT SHADOW PRISON that makes money off mass incarceration with no clear path for release. We should all be worried about freedom. We should all be concerned about men that have served sentences that were handed down by their peers and a judge. When did we become a government that throws the very tenets of the law out the window to make money? This place needs to be investigated and wrongs need to be righted.

We are deeply concerned that our children have been learning remotely for far too long. Many of our children have been 100% remote since March 2020, with a proposed return to school in late January 2021. However the history of this situation does not give us hope that a return to in-person learning will occur. While more than half of NJ school districts opened in September, some districts have remained closed since March and the promise of reopening has been repeatedly postponed.\nInitially, a state mandate guaranteed that all NJ children would have the opportunity for in-person learning during the 2020-2021 school year. That mandate was modified in August to allow districts to begin school remotely with an explanation, a plan, and a proposed reopening date. Many districts declared that they would go fully remote the very next day or soon after the mandate was issued. These districts have since proposed multiple reopening dates, only to pull those plans at the last minute and defer the date again and again. The latest promise of a January opening does not give us confidence that our children will return to school. We need more than promises. We need another mandate.\nAlthough many of our districts have completed the safety upgrades they said were required to transition to in-person learning, they have nonetheless delayed reopening due to high transmission rates of the virus. Governor Murphy, you yourself released a statement along with six other governors in which you said \u201cin person learning is safe when the appropriate protections are in place, even in communities with high transmission rates.\u201d During your news conferences, you have repeatedly said that school outbreaks have remained low and that you don\u2019t see a need to order schools to close. But that is in fact what is happening in our districts. We believe that if the reason for closure is due to high transmission rates, that decision should be across the board and consistent for all schools, not based on individual district preferences which leave some children going to school while others continue to struggle with no end in sight. We also believe that given that in person school provides an \u201cessential service\u201d, schools should be the last to close after non-essential businesses have closed.\nIndoor dining is open. Gyms, hair salons, and nail salons are open. Retail is open. So many non-essential businesses are open, yet providing the essential public good of in-person education to all of NJ\u2019s children remains optional. Hundreds of NJ school districts are open, and it has been a ray of light for those families to see their children learning, socializing, and feeling some sense of normalcy. Yet those of us who live in districts that stayed 100% remote are still waiting and hoping for that day to come. Our children have been home without an in-person education for over 10 months with no end in sight. The inequity of the situation is appalling and these children are suffering emotionally, intellectually, and physically as a result.\nSchools provide more than academics, they provide social and emotional learning, exercise, and for many children, access to healthy meals as well as a safe place to be while parents are working. Many families do not have the financial ability to hire a caregiver and are forced to choose between going to work and providing adequate care and support for their children. This only serves to further the social and economic division between privileged children and children from lower income families. For many families, private school, a pod, or an in-home caregiver is simply not an option.\nScience and health data collected throughout the pandemic show that schools, particularly elementary schools, are not driving the transmission of COVID-19. Transmission rates in schools are relatively low, especially when compared to other permitted activities such as indoor dining and small gatherings. The CDC, pediatricians, and mental health professionals are in agreement that it is essential to get the children back into classrooms. Remote learning is not an adequate or acceptable substitute for in-person learning. Children are disengaged, isolated, and depressed. Special needs students, students from low income families, and our youngest learners are being hit especially hard, and there is no way to discern how long it will take to reverse the damage.\nPlease help our children by giving them back the right to the public, in-person education that they deserve. We implore Governor Phil Murphy to re-issue the statewide mandate to provide in-person learning options for all school districts in NJ.\nNJ Families for In-Person Learning (NJFIL)\n&nbsp;\nPlease see below for links to some relevant articles supporting the points made in this petition:\nhttps://globalepidemics.org/2020/12/18/schools-and-the-path-to-zero-strategies-for-pandemic-resilience-in-the-face-of-high-community-spread/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/covid-having-devastating-impact-children-vaccine-won-t-fix-everything-n1251172\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/20/health-202-evidence-doesnt-support-closing-schools-stop-coronavirus/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/unicef-warns-of-a-lost-generation-and-finds-school-closures-are-ineffective.html?auth=login-google\nhttps://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/01/05/covid-school-safety-010521\nhttps://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/01/three-studies-highlight-low-covid-risk-person-school", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/gv/kb/zVgVkBkKmIohbuC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609344407"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/louisiana-state-senate-free-henry-montgomery?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "FREE HENRY MONTGOMERY", "description": "&nbsp;Henry Montgomery has been in jail for 55 years as of April 2019, for killing a police officer in 1963 when he was 17 years old.

Persons convicted of Measure 11 offenses receive no parole or reduction of sentence for good behavior while in prison. Giving these people no hope or desire to create change within themselves. No chance for rehabilitation opportunities. People should be able to&nbsp;prove their positive change. Research indicates that incentives can motivate people to complete programs while incarcerated, which in return can lead to better offender outcomes while reducing overall corrections costs. It can also&nbsp;produce positive benefits for key stakeholders by states reducing the costs of building and operating prisons; agencies receive funding to fortify their community supervision programs; and public safety improves through reductions in recidivism, crime, and revocation rates.\nThis Measure altered courtroom dynamics significantly so sentencing decisions would fall on the prosecutor, an advocate for the state, when traditionally that responsibility has been left to the judge, a neutral arbiter of justice. Shifting authority from the judge to the prosecutor and giving the state unjust leverage over an individual exercising their right to a fair trial.\nTDNFTC (Time Does Not Fit The Crime) committee team has been working really hard to advocate for equal rights within the correctional system. Measure 11 convictions are the only convictions who are not elegible to reduce their sentence for good behavior. Our committee drafted a Bill which has been approved and assigned a Bill number through the legislative process. SB 191&nbsp;is requesting&nbsp;equal rights for Adults in Custody with Measure 11 convictions to have the same equal opportunities as others in custody, to earn good time for good behavior.&nbsp;Everyone deserves the same opportunities!

We know and are aware every one has to pay the consequences of their behavior, which is \u201cwhy\u201d good behavior should be acknowledged as well. This gives people in custody hope and encourages a change of behavior to change for the better.

This involves hands-on learning and projects. The Animal Sciences program takes these things to heart. This hands-on approach provides students with an interactive experience that helps prepare them for job or intern possibilities. Removing the farm animals (or any other animals) would have adverse effects on the value of the program. The lack of farm animals would take away the experience that students would need to prepare them for going into college. It could also lower the interest of incoming students in the course, which would result in fewer people to care for the animals.\nThere are also risks to transporting the animals out of Arlington Tech. The animals may get stressed and anxious from the loud sounds and movement. It is also important that each animal is provided with proper food, water, and temperature that they need to have during travel. There is a possibility that the vehicles used to move them may not supply each and every animal with its necessities. In addition, these animals have spent many years living at Arlington Tech. They will become upset leaving the place and the people that have cared for them.&nbsp;\nFinally, many students are drawn to this program due to the opportunity to work with animals on a daily basis. Learning how to provide and properly care for them will benefit us in the future. These animals can encourage us to pursue our dreams of becoming groomers, veterinarians, zookeepers, kennel attendants, pet sitters, dog walkers, laboratory animal caretakers, veterinary technicians, wildlife biologists, and many more.

Metro West CD will be able to secure more than $7 million in federal and state tax dollars to complete the development.\nThe City will maintain control of the building by having a deed restriction on the property.&nbsp; This allows the City to set the parameters for the affordable housing use and provides the City with an important oversight role.&nbsp; As with all affordable housing in Waltham, the management for the Armory apartments would be required to report annually to the City\u2019s Housing Division to account for the income verification of the current tenants, rent rates, and a copy of all leases to ensure compliance with the affordable housing deed restriction.\nThe historical building will be preserved.&nbsp;The Armory is registered under the National Historic Registry, any changes made to the building will have to be approved by the State Historic Commission.What changes will be made to the appearance of the Armory?Minor changes are proposed such as the addition of dormers on the 3rd floor.&nbsp; This would be needed in order to fit the 23 units in the building.&nbsp; Affordable housing projects need to be over 20 units in order to be eligible for state and federal funding otherwise they would not be financially feasible.\nThere is support from Mayor McCarthy, the Waltham Community Preservation Committee, the Waltham Historic Commission, and WATCH CDC.\nMore Info at https://watchcdc.org/community-organizing-d1/armory/", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/md/vk/vlMDVKLVyKhynOA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608774317"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/members-of-congress-we-lock-down-all-the-time-in-school-enact-sensible-gun-reform-now?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Demand that Congress enact sensible gun reform!", "description": "The world watched in horror as the U.S. Capitol building, one of our cherished beacons of democracy, was raided by insurrectionists.The world saw your fear as you cowered, not knowing exactly who to fear or what they would do. Nobody blamed you. You had our empathy and we feared right along with you.But perhaps no one could empathize more sincerely than our nation's cadre of teachers and K-12 students. We regularly run through lockdown drills where we are forced to imagine some unknown assailant or assailants are stalking our halls, hoping that someone will make a noise to give away their location. We huddle with our students in silence. Our minds race about if we'll ever have to do this for real. And for tens of thousands of our students, they actually have. The Washington Post estimates that over 240,000 students have had first-hand experience with gun violence in their schools.&nbsp;But schools represent only a small part of the gun violence our children must suffer through. It is estimated by the American Public Health Association that between 1999 and 2017, nearly 39,000 children were killed by gun violence in this country. That's enough kids to fill nearly every seat in Citi Field in Queens, NY, where the New York Mets play.The shutdowns due to COVID have given our schoolchildren a small reprieve from that continual threat of violence. Hopefully schools can be fully open to welcome students back soon, but what level of safety will we be offering if nothing about the status of guns in our country has changed?\nWe are at a crossroads in our country, and while we have so many other problems to reconcile at this moment in history, we cannot reopen our country to all the same problems we've been able to forget over the last year of pandemic inertia.Members of Congress - we beg you: remember your fear, and your uncertainty, and the anger you experienced on January 6, 2021.

In observing this process I noticed several flaws in the way we go about these cases. Unfortunately, removing this statute would do nothing for this case specifically, so I will not be further elaborating on most of those flaws. However, I can focus on one major flaw and use my experience from this case to make a change for a better process for future victims. When this man was arrested, there were 7 cases against him. Thanks to the statute of limitations and its application to this case, there are now 2.\nAccording to the 4th edition of Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, the purpose and effect of statutes of limitations are to protect defendants and there are three reasons for their enactment:&nbsp;\n1. A plaintiff with a valid cause of action should pursue it with reasonable diligence.\nIn a case regarding developing minds, due diligence should not be necessary. These people need time to adjust to their reality.\n&nbsp;2. By the time a stale claim is litigated, a defendant might have lost evidence necessary to dispute the claim.&nbsp;\nIn most cases, this gives the defendant plenty of extra time to acquire and dispose of concrete evidence. I saw this firsthand with the defendant in said case, as he pulled out all of his laptops in a panic and wiped them clean after getting word of the investigation. The victims however still have no choice but to live with the evidence engrained in their memories.\n3. Litigation of a long dormant claim may result in more cruelty than justice.\nLitigation of a long dormant claim in the case of child abuse is necessary. By exercising this statute in these cases; we\u2019re throwing out multiple opportunities for justice and allowing far more room for cruelty on the victims end. &nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A statute of limitations sets in place an allotment of time in which a plaintiff can file a claim, in the state of Idaho a statute of limitations is amended to section 6-1701 as a tort action to defendants regarding child abuse and child sexual abuse cases. This statute of limitations gives the victim of a crime 5 years to come forward once they\u2019ve turned 18. The second they reach adulthood the clock is ticking for them to make sense of their situation, tell somebody, and muster the courage to take legal action. At that point it still can take months for someone to get their case off the ground, leaving them nothing to do when that time does pass. For a child going through abuse, especially from an adult perpetrator, that\u2019s the only reality they know. Children are especially resilient and will adapt to this lifestyle as normal. It\u2019s not until they become adults that they\u2019re allowed to make decisions for themselves, learn how their peers grew up and start to mark the differences. They have to completely dismantle the truth of life they made for themselves in order to survive, and start anew. These children have already lost years of their lives due to the fact that they were focused on survival, and with this statute in place we\u2019re taking away their first chance for justice so they can focus on thriving.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For these reasons I do not see due diligence as necessary as delayed reporting is not only normal but should be expected. There are other states in the US (7, to be specific) that have recognized this and removed the statute as pertaining to rape cases. This statute of limitations clearly does not apply to these type of crimes and therefore should be removed. By signing this petition you are declaring you\u2019d like to see change. Use your voice, speak up for the unheard, the silenced, and those who were denied justice.

Although UNICEF Adverts always states that \u201cqualified women are encouraged to apply,\u201d and while UNICEF's official report based on an independent investigation of Workplace Gender Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, Harassment and Abuse of Authority (commissioned by UNICEF Executive Director, Dr. Fore) found widespread evidence of abuse and harassment of whistleblowers, the organization has continued to fail to respond appropriately to the numerous reports of workplace harassment and extreme intimidation.\nPage 6 of the ITF report notes that \u201cthis \u2018results at any cost\u2019 approach has created an environment where offenses go un-reported or un-investigated and unpunished by the set rules, as long as programmatic results are achieved; and has enabled gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, harassment and abuse of authority, which thrive in such conditions\u201d which is to the greater detriment of female staff.\nPage 14 of the ITF report notes that \u201cStaff in focus groups and interviews also reported that gender-related discrimination occurs regularly in the workplace\u201d \u2026with data available to the Task team showing that \u201cof the 366 resignations of international professional staff in the last five years, 57 per cent were female.\u201d\nPage 15 of the ITF report notes \u201ca deeply-rooted authoritative management culture in UNICEF and identified a clear and repeating pattern in staff perceptions of this management culture\u201d \u2026the culture at UNICEF \u201chas concealed unacceptable workplace behaviours and allowed abuse of authority, harassment, sexual harassment and discrimination to proliferate in silence\u201d \u2026which led to misconduct being underreported, \u201cbadly investigated and not adequately sanctioned for a long time.\u201d\nThe above findings of the ITF illustrate the experience of Dr. Onabolu who worked with UNICEF at national and international levels for over a decade. Dr. Onabolu, a former staff member of UNICEF has been in an ongoing battle for justice after enduring a series of clearly documented incidents of discrimination, marginalization, dismissive behavior, verbal and even physical displacement, and abuse at her workstation in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Her documented experiences have yet to receive an independent and fair hearing and redress, despite going through all the internal formal and informal processes of UNICEF including a one-on-one meeting with the Executive Director, Dr. Fore.\nDr. Onabolu was a UNICEF WASH (Water Sanitation Hygiene Specialist) from 2006 to 2015 in Nigeria before being promoted and moved to her position in Bangladesh. At her station, she was the only senior black female specialist amongst other specialists and has excelled in that position; earning high scores on annual evaluations, creating important social networks, and having a considerable professional impact in the field.\n&nbsp;Things changed immediately after a new station Chief was posted to the office. Her new Supervisor, a white Irish male began a series of strategies of gaslighting, isolation, and workplace mistreatment designed to ensure her subservience. When she did not cave, he made it clear he did not want Dr. Onabolu on his team; he ridiculed her, reassigned her work after it was completed, refused to meet with her, and immediately wrote a negative evaluation shortly after he assumed his position. This was set aside after HR (Human Resources) determined he had not been in the station long enough to have information for such feedback. Despite her complaints, there wasn\u2019t any form of intervention capable of halting his assaults. With a white and male-dominated supervisor team, Dr. Onabolu and her struggles were silenced at the local level as other staff members were intimidated into silence or support of the gaslighting.&nbsp;\nAfter escalating her grievances to the headquarters, she was reassigned to a new duty station in New York City as a form of redress. She accepted the NYC reassignment with the promise of a one month paid leave, and four months of working from home. However, before she could resume her post, her reassignment to the new position was withdrawn without reason after she received an email from the UNICEF HR lawyer that she would not be resuming in New York and were unsure where she would actually be resuming work.\n&nbsp;There have been requests from women\u2019s rights advocates to address Dr. Onabolu\u2019s concern, however, her case continued to be sidelined and ignored. The continued extreme intimidation eventually resulted in a severe threat to her health. Despite medical reports indicating that the toxic environment was injurious to her health, she was given the ultimatum to either work under the same supervisor or leave the organization. For the sake of her health, she was forced to resign from UNICEF but has continued to fight for justice, accountability, and redress.\n&nbsp;Page 14 of the Abuse of Authority in UN offices of Bangladesh report notes that \u201cSignificant percentages of staff members have experienced SH (Sexual Harassment) and AA (Abuse of Authority) in UN offices in Bangladesh\u201d \u2026with the survey data provided showing that \u201cincidence of AA is considerably higher among female staff members compared to their male counterparts.\u201d\n&nbsp;Page 15 of the Abuse of Authority in UN offices of Bangladesh report notes that \u201cFemale staff members have reported a significantly higher incidence of AA. One-third of them have experienced such abuses, and as revealed during the group discussions, many of them are experiencing high levels of stress due to bullying behavior of the supervisor/higher authority.\u201d\n&nbsp;Not only do these actions contravene the UN\u2019s purported zero tolerance for workplace abuse, but it also goes against UNICEF's previous statements about how they intend to treat their employees who speak out against the wrongs of the organization. Dr. Onabolu\u2019s case is a representation of UNICEF\u2019s failure to address its own extremely problematic, discriminatory, and poor managerial skills as documented in Page 6 of the ITF report. \"Furthermore, dysfunctional support from systems designed to provide checks and balances on exercise of authority, such as the management of human resources, the complaint system and internal communication with staff, have exacerbated the negative consequences of this existing culture.\n&nbsp;We call on UNICEF Executive Director to live up to her claims of \u201cwhat we have to have is the courage to change\u2026 So, courage is what I am asking you all to think about. This means no bullying, no belittling, no malicious gossip. No harassment of any form. No discrimination. Not here, not here anymore,\u201d Fore continued (as reported by Devex in the town hall meeting with UNICEF staff to discuss the report).\nWe the undersigned, are calling for a fully independent and fair investigation, the strongest forms of accountability for all those found complicit in creating a toxic environment in the UNICEF Dhaka office, and appropriate redress.\n&nbsp;Sincerely,\nCarlos Abreu | cabreu@ithaca.edu\nChancelor Wahl | cwahl@ithaca.edu\nJordin Price | jprice@ithaca.edu\nNicole Cokely | ncokely1@ithaca.edu\nSelin Tuter | stuter@ithaca.edu\nTomas Garcia | tgarcia@ithaca.edu\n&nbsp;\nNote: Bolu Onabolu remains committed to the organization\u2019s core values of care, respect, integrity, trust, and accountability though unfortunately, the findings of the ITF report indicate that \u201cdespite good intentions, UNICEF is not living those values when it comes to this most important resource; its staff.\u201d She continues to push forward the mandate of UNICEF to actualize the human rights vision of ensuring access to safe water and adequate sanitation in her home country, Nigeria in her role as Strategic Advisor of WASHMATA Initiatives, an NGO she established after her forced resignation from UNICEF.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;References\n1.

They\u2019re inflicted with diseases, forced to take drugs, made to endure painful operations and experiments while completely conscious, injected with and force fed chemicals to test toxicity, restrained while lesions are cut into their brains and electrodes are implanted in them, blinded, starved, and suffocated. Can you imagine what it would be like to be in their position? There is no such thing as an illegal experiment on animals in the US. Our tax dollars fund these horrible experiments. The NIH itself has said that 95% of experiments found safe and effective in animals fail in human trials because they don\u2019t work or dangerous. For Covid-19, countless animals, including mice and primates have been tested on. Mice don\u2019t contract it naturally so they must be genetically engineered to get it. Neither develop severe symptoms. This is a waste of lives, money, and time. COVID-19 has left us with a golden opportunity to reimagine the way we approach science. The Animal Welfare Act is the only US federal law that sets standards for feeding, housing, handling, and veterinary care- but allows experimenters to restrain, burn, shock, poison, isolate, starve, mutilate and inflict brain damage on animals. Painkillers are not required. Not only is this evil and inexcusable, but if there were a tornado, the facility could be ripped apart, exposing residents of the area to toxins and diseases.

After my surgery, I was told by every OB/GYN I went to for help that my loss couldn\u2019t have been caused by my surgery and was all in my head.&nbsp;\n16 years later, not one top 20 OB/GYN program will agree to teach this anatomy, despite being entreated to do so by me and my plastic surgeon father.&nbsp;\nThere are many other women with stories like mine, who have lost clitoral function after biopsies, cosmetic surgeries, and repairs (including one after a rape). Preventable damage done during repairs likely goes unrecognized because women assume the original injury caused the damage, rather than their doctor.&nbsp;My loss was so traumatic it felt sometimes worse than death. It is made more painful knowing my injury isn\u2019t considered worth preventing. But it is worth preventing.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/sv/ij/oMsvijfNNBovXJg-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607702237"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/sony-pictures-entertainment-levar-burton-should-be-the-next-host-of-jeopardy?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Make LeVar Burton the next host of Jeopardy!", "description": "Between hosting 21 seasons of the educational Reading Rainbow, playing the brainiac engineer Geordi La Forge on Star Trek: the Next Generation, and filling the roll of Kunta Kinte in the ever important mini-series Roots, LeVar Burton has inspired and shaped the minds of several generations of trivia-loving nerds.

This is not just closing a bar this will cost jobs and will also cost the city Millions to demolish!! They also have no plan at all and are hoping they get a developer... this is from Jeff the bar owner/bar manager:Kim Norton - Mayor of Rochester, MN you are correct this has been in the \u201cworks\u201d for along time. I have leased that space since 2011 from the Labor Union. The city purchased the property in 2013 and continued to carry the lease with Legends. I knew at that time that my business time line was unknown. I agreed to the lease terms knowing that at some point the day would come that a developer would want the property. I was assured that I would be treated fairly and given plenty of notice when plans were brought forth to develop the property. The 90 day notice was put into place by the city after I had asked for a minimum of a 6 month notice reason for 90 day notice was in case a developer could or wanted to move quickly. I agreed to that because like a said I was reassured I would be given plenty of notice. The Bloom company decided they wanted to move ahead with a plan. I was put on notice that things were going to happen the media spread the word several times that Legends would be closing. It was detrimental to my business during those times. People didn\u2019t want to sign up for pool/dart leagues for fear that we would close etc. customer base was also declining because of the reports that we were closing. The Bloom company\u2019s plan never came together so I gained some more time to continue to grow my business and we pushed forward getting back to where we were pre-Bloom. I was told by a couple of council members and city staff that I was good to go and could remain open. Again being reassured that I would be given plenty of notice and especially now with the Bloom project off the table it would take several months to even get anything approved even if someone came in that day with cash and a plan. I was told a 6-9 month minimum timeframe before plans would be approved and underway. Fast forward. I received a letter from city staff saying the city was going to ask council to move ahead with a termination of my lease because of a development plan. Obviously I was devastated to receive this after having my business so drastically affected by the Covid-19 restrictions placed on us. We were closed for 3 months at the start of the pandemic then I chose to close in July for 24 days because of the increase of cases being linked to the downtown businesses then now this last closure lasting two months. I was hopeful that the governor was going to loosen up restrictions and we could work at getting back to trying to recover and move forward in recouping the lost revenue and get our employees back to work. During the first shutdown I took advantage of the time to do some remodeling and fixing things in the building that needed to be done. I spent approximately $10,000 of my own money not any stimulus or government money. In fact I never took any of the PPP money because the city staff worked with me and forgave and reduced some of my rent that I was extremely grateful so I didn\u2019t feel right about taking a handout from the government I wanted that money to go to businesses that needed it more then I did. In return I spent some of the money I would have had to pay for rent and put it back into the building. I have known for several years that this day would come but I feel like I\u2019ve been unfairly targeted. I was found to be in violation of not enforcing the mask mandate and social distancing on Halloween. I take full responsibility for that. I had my business closed by the health dept. for 72 hours I along with my staff worked with the health dept and was given the green light to reopen. Then a few weeks later council voted on offering liquor license holders help with fees and reducing fees for future licenses. Then a council member suggested that a business that was found to be in violation of the governors mandate should not be able to qualify for the help. Two businesses were declined the assistance my business was one of them. I felt like I was being punished again for a previous violation. I had already had my hand slapped by the health dept. Then just as the governor is about to announce a possible reopening of bars and restaurants I received my notice of intent that the city was to terminate my lease. I was lead to believe that a development was underway but only to learn that the property is going to be bulldozed to make way for a \u201cgreen space\u201d until a potential developer comes along. That could take years for someone to want to take the risk especially with the state our country is in with the pandemic etc. My business has been open and prospering for 9 years I have always worked with the city on any issues related to the building or the business practices etc. I encourage you to reach out to the police dept and health dept city staff etc and ask them for yourself. So I ask you are there any programs or funding offered through the city to help me out with relocating my business or am I just suppose to pack my things and get out? You along with city officials pride yourselves and encourage the people of this community during these trying and devastating times to \u201cSupport local small business\u201d by terminating my lease and forcing my business of 9 years to close for some \u201cgreen space\u201d doesn\u2019t really look like you or the city are practicing what you\u2019ve been preaching. For the record my business is not a Casuality of Covid-19 my business is going to be a casualty at the hand of the city of Rochester. If you would like to discuss this with me further please I encourage you to do so. City staff has my number. Good day!!

Approximately 2 million dogs die in puppy mills each year, mother dogs are euthanized when they can not have puppies anymore and many puppies are taken from their mothers too soon and die from disease because of it.

Of course, we believe our fellow winter and spring student-athletes should be afforded the chance to participate in their seasons, but we feel that we also deserve the opportunity to have one.\nAs one of the smallest Division I programs in the country, our school and community feels like a family. We understand that having all teams play at once would be difficult, but families sacrifice for one another. We acknowledge that winter and spring sports will take priority, and are willing to make sacrifices to have a limited season of games, especially since most fall sports last competed in November of 2019!\nIn the article and information that was given to us after the decision had already been made to cancel the competition season, it mentioned that this choice would greatly decrease the number of out-of-state visitors to campus, which would help mitigate the risk of virus exposure. While this may be true, with implementing the correct COVID-19 protocols, it should not matter how many players are traveling out-of-state for competitions. It has been proven that if the right policies are in place, a successful season for all teams is possible. We would like that opportunity and are willing to do whatever we can to play this season, whether that involves wearing masks during competitions or being careful outside of our sports and academics.\nAt this time, we are the only school, that we are aware of, in the NEC to opt out of the spring season for fall sports. We want to compete for Saint Francis University this season, and have been working diligently to do so, which is why we are frustrated and disappointed to be completely blindsided by this decision. We do not understand how this choice could have been made without clearly communicating to those that it directly impacts.

At the very least, that is the feeling of many parents due to the lack of transparency from the district.\nTime and time again, for almost a year surveys have been sent to parents, BOE meetings held and data regurgitated as to why the schools have only been open to the first level of 33% without moving past that or why they can\u2019t be reopened. The students want, need and deserve more!\nGive the parents information on what plans the task force team, BOE and superintendent have thought of, created or tried to initiate. Have you broken down #\u2019s of the positive cases, &nbsp;which the decision to keep the school shuttered is being made from? Do they consist mainly of the elderly being Old Bridge has one of the highest amount of assisted living residents within neighboring towns? If we were given this information, even if the plans failed, at minimum we would then know action is being taken other than looking at statistics only. &nbsp;The multiple surveys sent to parents the past (9) months give us hope that our opinions on what in person, hybrid or remote plans work best to meet the needs of our children have value in the decision making process. However, that has proven to not be the case at all! We are demanding a plan of action that is beneficial to the students of Old Bridge and not a temporary band aid.&nbsp;\nThe children, your students, are regressing educationally and emotionally to an extent that the effects are not yet known. That concern should be at the forefront of the districts mind! That is a more realistic concern than the fear of litigation being brought forth on the district for reopening schools. Again have all options been considered; Perhaps a waiver can be signed in terms of attending school to avoid litigation? Can the approved $153m district budget for 20/21 school year now be used to help our students directly with tutors, better devices, readily available books, etc? &nbsp;The funds allocated for new buses, transportation, maintenance, upgrades, etc seem to be null and void with school shuttered for almost a year.\nIf the concern is not enough teachers to teach the students, that of course is valid. Understandably teachers may not all be able to go back to in person learning &amp; have approved 504\u2019s, why can\u2019t those teachers continue to work remotely with the students who have opted out? Do the students who have chosen to opt out and stay remote correlate to the teachers who have 504\u2019s? Why not combine classes within grades..that will free up 1-2 teachers per grade to help cover those that have been approved as high risk with 504\u2019s. Maybe combine the Middle schools into (1) building for the remainder of the year? Of course we don\u2019t have full insight into the logistics so can\u2019t speak on if these options are even viable but those who do have insight, like the superintendent, the task force &amp; the BOE, should provide that information. Again, we want transparency!\nThe fact private schools within our own township, neighboring towns, our neighboring states with much larger student populations are able to go to school in person full time, 5 days a week with lunch being provided, physical education and recess given without being shut down speaks volumes.

When law enforcement was called and responded Don approached the deputy while holding a Semi-automatic handgun in his hands and proceed to point the weapon at the officer. He failed to drop his weapon and show his hands after multiple commands. He was finally arrested after back-up arrived and charged with multiple felonies, including assault on a law enforcement officer, unlawful use of a weapon while intoxicated, and armed criminal action. At that time Don\u2019s family called in favors to long-time Williams family friend Judge Franklin and charges were reduced to a misdemeanor of disturbing the peace.\nOn February 25th, 2020 Don filed to run for a second term. On that date he declared under penalties of perjury that he was not aware of delinquency of taxes; that was a lie. In reality, he owned 3 years\u2019 worth of real estate taxes on his home and 2 years\u2019 worth of personal property taxes. According to 115.306 Rsmo this makes him ineligible to hold office. Don appeared on KRMS trying to blame this blunder on a trust, but that trust dissolved in 2017 and at that time he took possession of the property. That is the same year that he quit paying taxes. He claimed he did not know he owed personal property taxes.\nOn May 28, 2020, Don accepted a campaign contribution from Mr. Larry Coleman in the amount of $3,000. Four days after that donation was received a letter was nailed to a tree in front of Mr. Coleman\u2019s property stating \u201c2nd Commissioner, Don Williams, has brought to my attention the issue of the existing roadway into your fields. Don has explained to me that this road has been used to access those fields for decades,\u201d The county then provided nearly one mile of gravel across private property leading to Mr. Coleman\u2019s property using OUR TAX DOLLARS to do so. Private roads are supposed to be maintained by the landowner and not the county. Don said during candidate debates that the county will be proposing a tax increase this year for road and bridge because it is underfunded. Don\u2019s opponent, Patrick Cochran testifies that Larry Coleman approached him and offered money to his campaign if he would agree to provide this road for him if elected. Patrick declined.\nDon also had the county road (McCubbins Point Rd) resurfaced approximately one mile servicing his family farm that holds his private residence, his sister\u2019s home, and stopping at his brother Nathan Willams\u2019 property, leaving the rest of the road unfinished. He has built structures on this same property and was able to slide by without proper permits acquired by the Osage Beach Fire Protection District who was aware of the construction.\nThis past week 1st District Commissioner James Gohagan was barred from his personal office and prevented from leaving the commission office building, physically threatened and verbally assaulted by a group of county maintenance employees while Commissioner Greg Hasty, Don Williams, and county attorney Charlie McElyea sat by. An audio recording of the incident reveals that Williams and Hasty participated in the event and enticed the situation. They went as far as telling the harassing employees that they loved them. It is alleged that one of these men had a gun in his pocket. These employees are still employed with the county by our tax dollars.\nDon Williams has proven that he has a long history of intimidating behavior and dishonesty. These occurrences not only bring his integrity into question but also his ability of judgment.

We have lived and breathed their fear, disappointment, anxiety, and depression during this extremely unique and life altering year. The kids are not all right. They will certainly be working through the effects of the last ten months for years to come. This is why we want to express our gratitude and support for the Chicago Public School plan to gradually return to in-person learning. We have watched communities and schools around the country successfully return, and we have faith in the public health guidance and CPS plan to bring our kids back to school and get our communities functioning again. What is truly sad, although not surprising, is the fear based campaign that the leadership of the Chicago Teachers Union has been spearheading since the summer. We have learned over the past year that the leadership of the CTU has no interest in advocating for the city\u2019s children, yet it is no less disturbing that CTU leadership seems determined to undermine literally any effort put forth by CPS to return to in-person learning, regardless of how well thought out and researched it is. We would like to voice our support for CPS leadership and thank all of the school administrators who are working tirelessly to bring the children back to school safely.\nDuring uncertain times, important decisions need to be made on facts rather than emotions. CPS put together a thoughtful plan, relying on the CDC\u2019s guidance, our local public health officials and our local medical community. There is no evidence to suggest that a gradual return to in-person learning for CPS students will be any different than other cities and school districts who have successfully reintegrated back into school buildings. One Yale study, including 57,000 child care providers across the United States found, \u201c...as long as there are strong on-site measures to prevent infection, providing care for young children doesn\u2019t seem to add to the provider\u2019s risk of getting sick.\u201d This has been further confirmed by many members of the medical community and expert sources, including the World Health Organization. Our public health experts have now had time to study other school success stories and ensure that CPS is well situated to manage an in-person learning experience safely, and make any required adjustments accordingly. CTU does not seem able to back their list of requests up with public health data or science to support their claims that a return to the classroom will result in more community spread.\nAnyone who leaves their house takes a risk when it comes to the spread of COVID-19. However, many schools in other states and major cities, suburban school districts, private and parochial schools have been in session since the fall (day care centers since the summer), yet there is no evidence that teachers are more at risk for contracting COVID-19 than anyone else going about their daily lives. The science simply doesn\u2019t support the claims that schools put individuals at risk more than any other environment outside of the home.We support the CPS plan to return the city\u2019s children to public school, thank the school administrators putting this plan into action, and would like to see the CTU leadership listen to the experts, stop fighting the return to the classroom with baseless information that invokes fear, and help our communities by supporting our children. In a recent Op-Ed in the Sun Times, members of the Chicago Pediatric and Infectious Disease medical community called this an, \u201cepidemic of serious psychological illness that has reached a crisis point.\u201d Our children need to return to school and the stakes are too high to deny them this.\nIf you are a Chicago parent, sign with us to show support for CPS and get our kids back to school.

If ever there was a time for Americans to take to the streets to denounce fascism and stand up for democracy, the time is now. Activists around America took to the streets this past weekend to march against the attempted fascist coup, exercising their First Amendment rights and standing up for our democracy.&nbsp;\nRamsey Alliance for Social Equity (RASE) was proud to be a part of this day of action. As we have done at every Sunday protest, we gathered and held signs by the train tracks on Main Street. Due to the severity of the threat to our democracy posed by the fascist coup attempt four days earlier, we came to the decision that briefly (less than 10 minutes) marching on one side of Main Street was a pertinent form of protest. We have done this a few times before, always peacefully and safely, and always without incident, often with a Ramsey PD escort.\nWhen we arrived at the destination of our brief march and began to exit the road, Ramsey Police Officer Brian Paul accosted the sole black protester, even though all of the protestors marched together in the road. The encounter ended soon without incident and Ramsey PD presented no charges against me, or anyone else, at that time.&nbsp; After this happened, Ramsey PD was accused of racial profiling, as reported in The Record on January 12.&nbsp; While Chief Gurney defended the actions of Officer Paul, the objective evidence is inconsistent with Chief Gurney\u2019s assertions.&nbsp;\nOn the morning of Wednesday, January 13, Nick Haas (founder of RASE) was served a summons charging him with two disorderly conduct offenses for marching down Main Street during Sunday\u2019s protest. These latent charges appear to be motivated by his perceived role in addressing the racial profiling that occurred on Sunday.\nRASE demands the following:\n1)&nbsp; All charges against Nick Haas dropped immediately.2)&nbsp; Mayor Dillon publicly condemn Officer Brian Paul\u2019s racial profiling, as well as the attempt by Chief Gurney to explain it away contrary to the objective evidence.3)&nbsp; Mayor Dillon publicly condemn the January 6 insurrection attempt at the Capitol in Washington, D.C..4)&nbsp; Ramsey Police Department publicly condemn the January 6 insurrection attempt at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., which resulted in the death of MPD Officer Sicknick, who was originally from NJ.5)&nbsp; Public statement from Ramsey Police Department apologizing for Officer Brian Paul\u2019s racial profiling, as well as for Officer McWilliams not wearing a mask and endangering the public while addressing the protestors, both of which were captured on video Sunday, 1/10.\nPlease sign this petition in support of RASE\u2019s mission to stand up against systemic racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, ableism, and all forms of discrimination as well as demand accountability from Mayor Dillon, Chief Gurney, and the Ramsey PD.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/jo/as/uoJoaSFVcEPxEMn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610649424"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/transition46-cuba-life-saver-not-terrorist-reverse-pompeo-trump-designation?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Cuba: Life saver not terrorist.

Grindline has built hundreds if not thousands of skate parks throughout the United States, which some very well have lights for a evening activity. Now here in stamford Connecticut Scalzi Park has lights for almost every activity, field , court at Scalzi Park except the skate park. From baseball to football to the basketball courts to the tennis courts to even the bocce and handball all are lit up and if I\u2019m not mistaken even the playground itself has lights. The skate park at Scalzi Park in Stamford Connecticut is one of the top attractions at Scalzi Park. Not just opened and played on during days of games or practices. No the skate park is open seven days a week and people from all over come to visit Scalzi skate park.This year alone in 2020 as hard as it was for the world. The skateboarding community at scalzi has came together stronger than ever and has pulled off events and even professional skateboarder\u2018s have came to visit Scalzi Park to visit the skate park. With lights at Scalzi skate park we can achieve Control so it\u2019s not as crowded during the day being able to broaden the range of times that we are able to use the skate park, witch will allow less people at once which is ideal especially during Covid.&nbsp;The city of Stamford should have someone to come fourth and lock the skate parks gate every night so nobody breaks in. Failing to do so results in non-skaters coming in at hours they are not supposed to ruining our place of action sports and put graffiti all over it. That results in two groups being highly upset #1 the city of Stamford because that\u2019s property that they paid for and to most importantly the skateboarders because that\u2019s very dangerous as the paint is 20 times more slip than the original concrete. Graffiti on the skate park alone is liability liability. If stamford was to grant Scalzi skate park lights that would mean that we would be able to solidify a committee to lock the gates at night so no one can further damage to the park and they can also guarantee the younger kids more freedom during their earlier sessions, versus the evening skate sessions the older gentleman can enjoy. &nbsp;With the great power of your voice we can make a change. This is something that the community has Really wanted since 2007. At the moment you can probably see a vast amount of younger kids on scooters with parents and a lot of the times they are put in danger and get in the way of the older kids skateboarding at high speeds resulting in some young kids possibly getting hurt. Even though the rules on the Scalzi skate park fence clearly state this is a skate park not for bikers, rollerbladers nor scooters and that it is also not for beginners. We still allow these kids and families to come in and have a great time and we welcome them with open arms. With&nbsp;lights once again as I reiterate can almost split us up so it\u2019s less of a chance that anyone could either get hurt, sick or furthermore. This isnt something that happens overnight but this is something that can happen. Next year will make it 15 years Scalzi skatepark has been open!!! Wow! I believe it\u2019s time to make this happen!! If You have ever visited Scalzi skate park or enjoyed it over the years be a big help in making this change because I guarantee everybody will be More than happy to see not only lights but a huge change in the structure of the park so we can guarantee safety as far as social distancing, the liability of more paint on the skate park and more.

Below is the text of the press release:&nbsp;\n\"Small Businesses Can Be Saved on Lefferts Boulevard Bridge / Community and Elected Officials Band Together in Response to MTA\u2019s Request for Proposal&nbsp;\nKew Gardens community organizations are partnering with the Mutual Housing Association of&nbsp; New York (MHANY), a not-for-profit housing and commercial property development&nbsp; organization, to submit a unique response to an MTA request for proposal (RFP). The RFP calls&nbsp; for managing the 14 stores that are at the heart of this community\u2019s main shopping area and are&nbsp; situated on the Lefferts Boulevard bridge over the LIRR mainline tracks. This is the first time that&nbsp; a not-for-profit housing and property development organization has pitched to manage MTA-owned properties, and they have done this in conjunction with the community and the store owner&nbsp; representatives with the intent of maintaining the existing character of the buildings.&nbsp;\nThe Lefferts Boulevard Bridge has suffered from years of MTA mismanagement. Because of this neglect, approximately $11 million in capital improvements will be required for the buildings, and&nbsp; an additional $5.5 million will be necessary to repair structural work on the bridge. The MTA&nbsp; expects the master lessee to bear the considerable cost burden of these repairs even after the City&nbsp; has given money to the MTA in the past to make repairs to this structure. The RFP also specifically&nbsp; states that the stores will be delivered empty. Existing small mom and pop stores who have served&nbsp; the community for over 20 years and are already hit hard by the pandemic\u2014will be forced to close&nbsp; under these conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIn response to concerns about the lack of community input (there is no requirement for community&nbsp; involvement in the MTA RFP) and the forced closure of the stores, Kew Gardens\u2019 four state&nbsp; representatives Senators Comrie and Addabbo, Assemblymen Rosenthal and Hevesi, and City&nbsp; Councilwoman Koslowitz sent a letter to the MTA requesting that the RFP be pulled and&nbsp; reformatted to reflect community input and to protect the existing store owners ability to continue&nbsp; to operate. To date, their plea went unanswered.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMHANY\u2019s proposal to operate this property is an inclusive one, allowing for community&nbsp; representation while giving long-time store owners a chance to thrive at affordable rents\u2014rents&nbsp; that for-profit organizations could not provide.

While this review process was deemed comprehensive and collaborative, we feel this is not an accurate description, as the administration failed to speak with any current BFA dance students about their experience in the program. As a result, current students of the program believe it is not only fair, but imperative to fight this decision and make the voice of every person who has been positively impacted by the program heard.\nThe BFA program is designed to set aspiring professional dancers and choreographers up for successful careers in a competitive artistic industry. While the current BA Dance Major is designed for students who have dual interests and wish to double major/minor in another field of study. In comparison to the BFA degree, the BA is an exploratory degree program to study any and all aspects of dance and is more flexible. While the BA degree will still be offered, we are worried that this learning experience for BA\u2019s will be diminished if it is transformed after the BFA deletion.\nWe do not know what all will encompass the deletion of the BFA Dance degree but do know the following are possibilities: cutting some of our class topics, cutting some of our performances, and even cutting possible choreographic opportunities. As mentioned above, these opportunities are vital to the growth of students and would be a devastating loss, not just for the BFA dance students but for all students attending River Campus classes and those with majors that require this experience and knowledge.\nAs current dance students and supporters of the dance program we are deeply affected and incredibly saddened by this decision. This is not just a career; it is a passion; a way of life. Our voices were not accounted for in this decision and given the impact it will have on not just our lives but possibly the future of the dance program, we believe it is imperative to oppose this decision.\nIt is important to oppose the deletion of the BFA Dance Major at Southeast Missouri State University, for the students' voices were not heard during the decision-making process conducted by the university.

The second reason is to plead with those individuals that have a decision in the naming of schools in our district. During the decision making process, please consider honoring this fallen civic leader who served countless days and hours working to progressively improve this school district. The research has shown that this astonishing woman exceeds the qualifications in the naming of the next elementary school or of any school . I am amazed that this has not been presented prior to now. Many current school board members served alongside this extraordinary woman. Within the recent year, I have been involved in many facets of the school district. I am beginning to understand the dynamics in the decision making. This is the reason I am bringing this to your attention. I understand that my request is premature. However, I also know that our town/city is continuing to grow; meaning school populations will increase. This will cause new school construction for our district. I intend to be proactive and persistent so that this subject is on the School Board\u2019s minds and hearts.&nbsp;\nIn my opinion, naming a school after Ms. Eddie Lagway is well deserving and an honor considering her commitment and service to the community and the school district. This community and school district consist of diverse ethnic groups, and all ethnicities should be represented in the community. Ms. Lagway, as many referred to her, was impactful to Willis residents. When mentioning her name alone to individuals in the community, you will be amazed about the conversations. I ask you to research this phenomenal woman. Her death caused a media coverage. Our local newspaper, the Conroe Courier broadcasted her on the front page for several days. You would be stunned about the comments expressed by reporters and community representatives. You will then see the life she lived and how she served in this school district and community and why she is more than qualified and deserving of this huge and amazing honor. Our community took a devastating loss when Ms. Eddie Lagway passed away.\nPlease read my favorite articles about her life and service that I have attached below. Eddie Ruth Lagway Being good at what you do is something that we all strive for in life. ExpertBail Agent Eddie Lagway of Lagway Bail Bonds was no different. She was a fantastic bail agent...but even more importantly she was a fantastic person. Unfortunately, Eddie's time ended last week when she passed away from a heart attack at age 55. She will be solely missed by everyone in her home city of Willis, Texas. Eddie spent her life doing things for others. Whether it was helping someone bail out a family member or just playing a role in her community to help others, she was always doing something positive. To say she was extremely active in her community would be an understatement. From the local school district to her local church, she spent every day trying to make life better for everyone. As a founding member of the city's Community Development Corporation, she played a key role in the city's pocket parks. She also played an active role in the School District as well as founded the WISD Education Foundation, which most recently ensured that the 1967 A.R. Turner High School Football team received their state championship rings. Eddie, you were a wonderful person to know and everyone who ever met you would say the same. We are extremely proud to have worked with you and called you an ExpertBail Agent and a member of our AIA family. We wish you peace. As you can see I am not asking too much in her honor she is a woman who is well deserving of an honor such as naming a school in the district that she served so diligently.

It also paves the way for other projects to irrevocably change the look and feel of Lake Forest forever. Additionally, existing Lake Forest property owners and taxpayers, who purchased their properties under the current zoning, stand to lose value on their homes. Historic districts are created as a way to protect and preserve the most valuable attributes of the community.

As per India's constitution, the central&nbsp;government&nbsp;of India cannot create laws for the agricultural sector. It is within the right of a state\u2019s government to create agricultural laws.\nModi's&nbsp;government&nbsp;passed&nbsp;agricultural laws&nbsp;in both houses without discussing them with the oppositional party members which are against the practice of parliament.&nbsp;\nThese laws will completely privatize India's agricultural sector. Farmers will be trapped under the contract of large corporate houses indefinitely. Farming has been a hereditary profession for the farmers and these laws will ruin their livelihood since they were legislated to assist corporate players.\nNo farming organization requested for the creation of these laws, which questions the objective behind its introduction.&nbsp;\nPrior to the protest, the farmers stated that they would march peacefully towards Delhi and protest there through peaceful practices.&nbsp;When the group of farmers was approaching Delhi to protest, Modi\u2019s government took egregious actions to stop them. They created immense holes on national highways, utilized water cannons, tear gas, and baton charges in the cold weather to cease the farmers.\nModi is the leader of democracy; however, he has taken an inhuman approach toward the protesting farmers, resembling the actions of a dictatorship.

We are extremely&nbsp;concerned about the educational, emotional, social and physical health of our children. &nbsp;Collectively we have established this petition so that our voices are united and strongly heard in hopes that we can be instrumental in the redevelopment of the educational model currently in place.\nWe feel it is vital for our children\u2019s educational development that they receive five consecutive days of in person instruction each week, for a minimum of four hours a day. While we know there are challenges to be met in doing so, we are certain that our team of educators, health professionals and parents can come together to make this an achievable goal for the good of Livingston\u2019s students. &nbsp;\nHaving five days/week of in-person school is essential for our children who choose to do so. The CDC, and the NJ Department of Health allow in person school five days per week, therefore we see no reason why the Livingston Board of Education cannot resolve the issues at hand and get our children back in school. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), opening schools does not significantly increase community transmission when guidance outlined by the CDC are followed, especially with young learners. The AAP also explains that that desks may be placed three feet apart when six feet is not feasible; and that harm may outweigh the potential benefits of strict adherence to a six feet spacing rule.&nbsp;\nArticles written by highly respected national education leaders have pointed out the deficits our children will face now and in the future due to the lack of in person school and services. &nbsp;The effect of nearly a year or more of remote and/or hybrid learning will more than likely have a lasting effect on their long term educational success and college and career goals. In addition, the extreme levels of isolation they have experienced since March must be eliminated by creating a new model that reverses this devastating blow to both their mental and physical growth. &nbsp; &nbsp;\nWe are certain that the current cohort model does not meet the needs of elementary school learners. Many districts throughout Essex County and the broader tri-state area have worked hard and have found ways to bring students safely and successfully back into the schools every day. While some schools are open for five half days and the children eat lunch at home, others have been open for five full days, eating lunch safely at school. Many private schools in our immediate area have also allowed for students to be in school for a full day, every day. &nbsp;We strongly believe that if they can do it Livingston can too.&nbsp;\nAccording to Dr. Block there are forty homerooms across the elementary schools that cannot fit students in the classrooms six feet apart. Many other schools seat their children less than six feet apart with plexiglass surrounding them. This has been successful in various schools throughout New Jersey, as well as many on Long Island and Westchester. These districts have utilized other staff members to watch the class during lunch so teachers can receive their break. Many districts that cannot accommodate the entire class seated six feet apart, utilize large spaces such as the cafeteria, library, gym and other common areas.\nWe as parents, voters and tax payers, know that the Livingston school district is rich in resources and can creatively work together to support an elementary cohort model which provides a consistent schedule of five days a week for in person, in school learning for students who choose to do so. &nbsp;This new model must be cast without delay for the sake of our children, the learners you have committed to educating. &nbsp;We request that you include some parents as part of the team in creating the new model. The current hybrid model, which has our children coming to school less than 5 days/week does not meet the standards that we consider essential for our children, and therefore please know that we no longer support it.\nWe implore you to make the necessary changes to the current elementary hybrid model. We strongly believe and are confident that Livingston Public Schools as leaders in education can find resolution to the setbacks this virus has caused. In doing so, our children can once again thrive academically, socially and emotionally. &nbsp;Thank you for your attention.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/zh/dp/jNzHdpxBznDaFyI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610667506"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/norwood-ohio-keep-911-services-in-norwood?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Keep 911 services in Norwood!", "description": "\u203c\ufe0f URGENT \u203c\ufe0f\nIF YOU OR A LOVED ONE LIVES/WORKS IN NORWOOD OR OWNS A BUSINESS OR PROPERTY IN NORWOOD, PLEASE READ THIS!!!\nMayor Victor Schneider has decided to get rid of the Norwood Communications Center.

While well-intentioned, there's been no communication regarding parameters required to re-open our playgrounds for children to play. [Chart of open vs. closed city playgrounds across the State of Texas for reference.]\nThe goal of this petition is to prompt local RGV city and county-level officials to re-open playgrounds. The alternative, acceptable result would be to clearly communicate what benchmarks we can expect as communities to allow for playground re-openings.&nbsp;\n\nMany Texas cities never closed playgrounds or have already re-opened given the lack of evidence supporting playgrounds are a source of virus-spread. \u201cThere is no science that indicates a playground or overnight camping is more dangerous than hiking or going to the beach,\u201d said Dr. Monica Gandhi, medical professor of infectious diseases at the University of California-San Francisco. \u201cOutdoors is much more safe than indoors and we should be encouraging activities and exercise during this difficult time as we get to the final stretch of the pandemic waiting for vaccines. Moreover, surface transmission is not a factor in spread. This is a respiratory virus.\u201d\nThere are discrepancies among RGV cities as to which cities are allowed to have playgrounds opened &amp; this is confusing and contradicting to the narrative that playgrounds are \"unsafe.\" [See chart]\nNot every family has access to a safe neighborhood, personal playground equipment, or backyard to play in. While parks are open, the utilization rate has dropped since playgrounds are not available.&nbsp;\nWe believe that issues such as lack of access to playgrounds are further exacerbating the challenges children face in this region such as childhood obesity and other socioeconomic disadvantages that prevent them from using indoor, commercial facilities for play that are proved to be less safe.\n\u201cPlaygrounds are not optional, they are essential. Play is how children develop executive function, cognitive abilities and gross motor skills. Playgrounds are vital urban infrastructure, particularly for those who live without equitable access to outdoor space. The need for structured places to play outside is especially important now, when children are stuck at home without in-person school, team sports or physical education. Not only do swings and slides in playgrounds let kids get the exercise they need for healthy sleep patterns, but outside play is also critical in helping kids settle down for online learning.\u201d\nGuidelines such as mask-wearing would still be required and parents would be responsible for assisting children with distancing and hand-sanitization. City parks may also place an occupancy limit and hand-sanitizing stations. The discretion of parents, as in many other locations (playground or non) is something that we face in our decision-making process and the same applies to playground use. \n\nThis petition does not, in any way, make light of the seriousness of the pandemic. We acknowledge that the spread of this virus in a playground setting is not 100% preventable and realize that many city decisions are to avoid liability and community spread. However, the consequences of not re-opening are very serious and will have long-term effects on children's mental and physical well-being in the RGV communities.

There is absolutely nothing glamorous about dead animals or loved ones. There are plenty of alternatives which are of great quality. There should be no space for these now. Law needs to be passed to make the fur trade illegal all across the world, in order to force companies to work with alternative material and stop glamorizing the fur product.\nGovernments cannot respond to this crisis simply by culling millions of animals and then allowing farmers to return to business as usual. The appalling conditions on fur farms make them a ticking time bomb for pandemic disease risk.&nbsp;Twenty countries have already acted to ban the farming of animals for their fur because it is cruel, outdated, and unnecessary.

GWA\u2019s football team has thrived under Coach Davis\u2019s leadership, and he is a trusted, lifelong educator and coach who works with integrity and passion. Coach Davis teaches his players how to play the difficult games of football and life, instilling Christian principles of grace and forgiveness while striving for excellence and discovering their best selves. We understand that Dr. Dolan, as Head of School, has ultimate and unilateral power to hire and fire faculty and staff without board oversight or approval. As current and future investors in GWA, we insist the by-laws be amended to mandate board oversight and approval for staff and faculty hiring and firing, and, in the case of the coaches, to include the Athletic Director\u2019s concurrence.

When protestors questioned why Prusayev was not wearing a mask and exercised their First Amendment rights to demand justice for Hill and all Black Lives lost to police violence, Prusayev responded by pulling out his gun in the direction of protestors, which included members of the BIPOC community.&nbsp;\nPrusayev then looked at the female officer, who did not draw her gun, and put his gun back in his holster. Moments later, however, Prusayev pulled out an expandable baton, aggressively whipping it open.&nbsp;\nThis is a clear show of excessive force, and was in fact condemned by Keith Ross, a former master instructor for the NYPD Police Academy.&nbsp;\nProtestors did not touch, menace, or threaten Prusayev. They held phones, not weapons, in their hands. There is no justification for his actions.

Not killing life, the Buddha seed grows.Transmit the life of Buddha and do not kill\u2014Eihei Dogen Zenji\nEvery version of the Buddha\u2019s ethical precepts begins with this principle: Do Not Kill. Buddha and all the great spiritual teachers \u2014 Jesus, Mohammed, the Hebrew prophets, Gandhi \u2014 tell us that life is sacred; that violence only begets violence. The logic of cause and effect, karma and its fruit, are inescapable even when you dress them in the emperor or president\u2019s clothes of punitive and retributive justice.On November 25, 2020 the U.S. Justice Department announced new regulations allowing for the use of new, or rather, old methods for federal executions, including the firing squad and electrocution. According to The New York Times:\nLast week, the Justice Department announced that it plans to execute three more inmates on federal death row. If the administration does so, along with two other executions already scheduled, it will have put 13 prisoners to death since July, marking one of the deadliest periods in the history of federal capital punishment since at least 1927\u2026\nAs Soto Zen Buddhist priests and teachers, as people of faith, we vigorously oppose state-sponsored murder and this rush to punish. We see capital punishment as the enactment of a cruel and primitive urge for vengeance draped in the fabric of legality. We believe that capital punishment degrades and brutalizes our society by teaching violence in reaction to violence.The harm of capital punishment does not just fall on the person put to death, but on our whole society \u2014 on guards and technicians, wardens, governors, on families of victims, and on each of us allowing this barbarism to go forward in our name.Capital punishment is the cutting edge of America\u2019s penal system. Social scientists, clergy, politicians, and communities of color all know that this is a broken system, although it is remarkably effective for sowing the seeds of violence. We see no evidence or statistics that capital punishment serves as an effective deterrent to crime. Resting on a foundation of inequality, based on racism and privilege, capital punishment cannot be fixed. Let\u2019s end it now, everywhere!People of faith and conscience wish to build a new system of justice based on love, restoration, and redemption. Let those be the lights that guide us. We believe that social and personal transformation are always possible, and that even wounded people can change and contribute to society. While it is true that people reasonably expect protection from those who\u2014by reason of mental illness, and extreme physical or psychological trauma \u2014 prey on others, the great majority of all prisoners are capable of transformation. This is our understanding of human nature. As for the handful who must be restrained or separated for their own protection and the safety of others, even these prisoners must be afforded life, a humane environment, and the possibility of meaningful work.We believe that there is no fair or practical way to arrive at a sentence of death. Our criminal justice system is so weighted against the poor and against men and women of color that an even application of the law is impossible. In recent years we have seen many death sentences overturned by new DNA evidence and prosecutorial misconduct. We also see that capital cases are often based on forced confessions, mistaken identification, and jailhouse informants. To continue with capital punishment in its present state means that more innocent people will be executed.In his version of the First Precept, Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh writes: \u201cI am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to condone any killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of life.\u201d This is pretty straightforward, but the hard work is before us.What is our work? Organize against the death penalty in your communities, in your centers and temples. Study and talk about the death penalty; debate it with your friends. Write to the U.S. Attorney General and the President\u2014outgoing and incoming\u2014and speak your opposition and convictions. When federal or state executions are scheduled, join with sisters and brothers of all faiths sitting at the prison gates to bear witness. This is important. We must speak for humane policy and compassion with our bodies. Verse 129 of the Dhammapada, Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s early teaching, says: \u201cAll tremble at violence; all fear death. Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill.\u201d May we live with this awareness and save all beings.\n\u2022 We ask the U. S. Federal Government to immediately halt all planned Federal Executions.\u2022 We ask for a Nationwide moratorium on Federal and State Executions.\u2022 We ask for our legislatures to reform the justice system to be one of restoration and redemption.\nAction Items and Information on the Death Penaltyhttp://deathpenaltyaction.org/take-actionhttps://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-congress-abolish-the-federal-death-penalty/https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/https://action.aclu.org/petition/stop-federal-executionshttps://catholicsmobilizing.org/take-action-stop-federal-executions-1", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/kl/eh/oVKlEHkaYMowFRn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606768082"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/greece-must-recognize-the-albanian-genocide?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Greece must: Recognize the Albanian Genocide!", "description": "The Greek government should&nbsp;Recognize&nbsp;and&nbsp;Apologize&nbsp;to the Albanian people for the brutal Genocide conducted by The Greek (para) military and headed by Greek General Napoleon Zervas in 1944 in the region of Chameria. Thousands of innocent women children and elderly were slaughtered in the most inhumane way, burned alive, beheaded, beaten to death, shot, raped in-front of their children and killed. Thousands of survivors were forced to walk to Albania where many died during the trail. The survivors are still banned to return back to their homes or even visit their parents' graves.&nbsp;Exactly seventy-six years ago, in 1944, Greek authorities under resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. On June 27, 1944 more than 600 men, women, and children were massacred in a town called Paramithia.&nbsp; From June 1944 to March, 1945, 1286 people were killed in the town of Filat. 626 people were massacred in Margellic and Parga and 192 were killed in Gumenica. In total, 2900 men, 214 women, 96 children were killed.&nbsp; 745 women were raped. 32 children, who were less than 3 years of age, were massacred. 68 villages of Chameria were razed to the ground. 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down. Valuable property that belonged to the Chams was confiscated.&nbsp;The 1912 Ottoman Census about Chameria illustrates the following: There are five major regions within Chameria:(1) Gumenitza (with 10,126 Albanians)(2) Filati (22,348 Albanians)(3) Paramithia (13,780 Albanians)(4) Margariti (15,732 Albanians)(5) Parga (800 Albanians).&nbsp;\nThe total number of people in these territories, the census states, was 71,983. Out of this population 62,786 were Albanians. The rest were Greeks and some Jews.&nbsp;\nWE DEMAND:1. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on the Greek government to recognize the existence of the 80,000 Albanians living in Chameria today and all other ethnic minorities in Greece.&nbsp; In spite of the fact that Greece is a member of NATO and the European Union and that it has signed all international covenants on human rights, the Greek government officially denies the existence of Chamerians and all other ethnic minorities in Greece.&nbsp; Greek citizens of Albanian, Turkish, Macedonian, Vlach, and Roma descent do not enjoy fair and equitable treatment under the law and face enormous obstacles in preserving their culture and exercising their right to freedom of expression and freedom of religion.&nbsp; The international community must make Greece accountable for its failure to recognize ethnic minorities living inside their borders and to protect their rights.\n2. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on the Greek government to publicly apologize for the fact that \u201cChams\u201d were the victims of successive waves of mass expulsion and genocide, culminating in the massacre of more than 5,000 men, women, and children, the forcible expulsion to Albania and Turkey of 35,000 more, the confiscation of thousands of acres of Cham-owned land, and the looting and burning of 68 Albanian villages and towns and a hundred mosques from June 1944 to March 1945. &nbsp;\n3. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on the Greek government to recognize the right of Cham survivors and their descendants in exile to return to their land and to receive recompense for their destroyed and stolen assets, involving approximately 150,000 people and property valued at more than two billion dollars in today\u2019s market.&nbsp; It is incredible that the Greek government, which condoned the seizure of Cham property in law at the end of World War II, has denied the survivors and their descendants even the right to visit their ancestral lands.\n4. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on Greece to respect the human and civil rights of Chams, as well as the rights of approximately 500,000 Albanians living in Greece today as temporary workers.&nbsp; Albanians in Greece seek equal protection under the law, freedom from forced assimilation and governmental repression, and opportunities for public employment and education in their own language.&nbsp; They should enjoy the same rights that the Greek minority enjoys in Albania. &nbsp;\n5. Albanian Roots NGO believes that to successfully resolve the Cham problem, Albanian Americans need to educate the West about Chameria (\u00c7am\u00ebria) and to create a strategy for \u201cinternationalizing\u201d the Cham problem. &nbsp; We need to make it clear that Chamerians (Albanians of Greece) are requesting recognition of their ethnicity, the restoration of their human and civil rights, the right to use the Albanian language, the restitution of their assets, and the right of return. This effort will not be easy, because the Greek lobby is one of the largest contributors to House and Senate reelection races in the United States, and Western Europe is reluctant to take on any issue that can potentially destabilize its neighbors to the south.&nbsp; But the diplomatic path must be taken and played out in 21st century terms. Justice, so long denied to Chameria, is finally to be achieved.&nbsp; &nbsp;LINKS:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-albania-greece-chams-idUSKCN1G80OOhttps://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/albanias-cham-population-wants-greek-apology-for-wartime-expulsion/https://in.news.yahoo.com/albanias-chams-want-greek-apology-wartime-expulsion-154239105--sector.html?soc_src=social-sh&amp;soc_trk=mahttps://eu.greekreporter.com/2018/02/25/albanias-chams-demand-apology-from-greece-photos/http://illyriapress.com/75-years-of-chamerian-genocide-by-greece/https://albanianstudies.weebly.com/cham-issue.htmlhttp://www.albanianhistory.net/1946_Cham-Albanians/index.htmlhttps://albanianroots.com/albanian-genocide-by-greece-75-year-anniversary/\nVideo Testimonies of Survivors:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RTuSBaoagshttps://youtu.be/_eMisOWySzMVideo Documentaries:Italian Documentary - https://youtu.be/7DehrZjdW68https://youtu.be/vsjWIjO1gychttps://youtu.be/m4z7dT0ZMschttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BbAyDBMoEUhttps://youtu.be/OgI0VE0DH0whttps://youtu.be/Zc2imOlc79YPhotos of Cham Albanian Refugees - &nbsp;UN Archives&nbsp;http://www.albanianphotography.net/cham/\nGreek scientists accept Greek's - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5dePt4U74Ihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsjUKLn9c94&amp;feature=emb_logo\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/ai/xu/WVaiXuWFzvwHhsb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610045630"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/bend-lapine-school-district-keep-education-online-until-after-vaccinations-have-been-locally-distributed?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Keep education online until after vaccinations have been locally distributed!", "description": "Covid 19 has created hardships for everyone.Education is more difficult virtually but this does not give us a reason to open in person schooling while cases are still astronomical.

Despite this, the county\u2019s Development Advisory Board (DAC) has approved the destruction of 326 acres of this mature forest in the Bush River Watershed. The headwaters of the Haha Branch and a large portion of the stream flow through this forest, and the mature trees and wetlands filter the water flowing to the Chesapeake Bay. The Maryland Department of the Environment has said that every tributary flowing into the Chesapeake is critically important to help manage the massive levels of water pollution, and protect the Bay.\nWhile Abingdon Woods is a crucial part of protecting the Bay, this beautiful forest also improves the quality of life for county residents. This forest is in the middle of a residential area, and directly adjacent to an elementary school. The current pandemic has highlighted the importance of having access to the outdoors. Sadly, many residents living in the development envelope don\u2019t have access to trails or the luxury of open space. They can\u2019t \u201csocial distance\u201d without standing in a parking lot or keeping their kids indoors all day. In this time of crisis, Harford County\u2019s decision to turn this incredibly beautiful and ecologically important forest into parking lots and warehouses is both horrifying and irresponsible. Worse still, it will be paved over to build more large warehouses and parking lots in the middle of a residential area along Route 40, where there are currently 18 existing vacant warehouses in Joppatowne alone.\nThis forest in the Bush River watershed is crucial for water quality, provides essential habitat, regulates the climate, cleans the air and is essential to the wellbeing and safety of the citizens within the development envelope, who deserve open space too. The county council and county administration have ignored their own county planners who identified the Abingdon Forest as \u201ca Core Forest which should be protected and preserved\u201d, as part of Harford County\u2019s Green Infrastructure Plan.\nSo who is doing this? The property is owned by the Chesapeake Real Estate Group, led by former Maryland Secretary of Transportation James Lighthizer.&nbsp;The proposed development plan has been allowed to proceed because of the questionable practices of the Harford County Council, led by County Executive Barry Glassman. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation is currently challenging the County\u2019s approval of the forestry management plan, which is completely inadequate. A local group, Harford County Climate Action, is raising money to file an injunction to try to prevent the County from rushing the destruction of the forest to avoid a court ruling.\nWe are asking the Harford County Council, and specifically County Executive Barry Glassman, to act now to stop this destruction. The Council can ensure that no action is taken to destroy the site while court cases proceed. But more importantly, there are numerous funding sources available to preserve the site. We urge the County to use Open Source funding to purchase the site from the Chesapeake Real Estate Group, and turn it into a public park.\nCheck out the GoFundMe page set up by Harford County Climate Action to pay for the court costs of the injunction, and see the video put together by residents and activists: https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-abingdon-woods?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet", "image_url": "https://static.change.org/profile-img/default-user-profile.svg"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/u-s-senate-hold-roger-marshall-accountable-for-his-actions?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Hold Roger Marshall accountable for his actions", "description": "On November 3, 2020, Roger Marshall was elected to the US senate by the state of Kansas.\nOn January 3, 2021, Roger Marshall was sworn into the US senate, swearing to represent the people and interests of Kansas whether they voted for him or not.

At the beginning of this school year, Shore Regional adapted its schedule to better accommodate the needs of its students, parents, teachers, and support staff. We are petitioning to stop the planned changes of the schedule and continue with the schedule we have had for the entire 2020/2021 school year.&nbsp;\nIn summary, we respectfully request that the schedule remain the same. For the following reasons:\n\nSanitation\nEfficient class periods\nPredictability\n\nVirtual Wednesdays provide numerous benefits. Most prominent is the capacity to properly sanitize the school. This day provides a buffer between the two cohorts which greatly reduces the potential pool of people exposed in the case a student or teacher tested positive for Covid-19. The recent events at Frank Antonides and Betty McElmon in West Long Branch where&nbsp;45 people&nbsp;were exposed and&nbsp;5 people&nbsp;tested positive highlight just how important this is.&nbsp;\nAdditionally, virtual Wednesdays are a great opportunity for teachers to assign work and review lessons in the middle of the week. In many classes, teachers will review homework or a lesson during the thirty-minute class period on Wednesday and administer the test on Thursday or Friday. Many find that a ninety-minute block is just not necessary for these simpler tasks.\nFinally, the predictability of the current schedule is invaluable. As it stands, the schedule is highly predictable. Every Monday and Thursday is a blue day, every Tuesday and Friday is a white day, and Wednesday is a virtual day. This makes scheduling doctor's appointments and other daily tasks much easier in advance as we know what classes we have and when we have them.

In passing the Act, Congress inserted an amendment, Sec. 3 (b), directing the federal government to do nothing for American bison held in sacred public trust as wildlife: \u201cNothing in this Act or the adoption of the North American bison as the national mammal of the United States shall be construed or used as a reason to alter, change, modify, or otherwise affect any plan, policy, management decision, regulation, or other action by the Federal Government.\u201d\nThe American bison, held in sacred public trust as wildlife, needs protection!\nWe cannot honor our National Mammal, and their relationship to Native Americans, by allowing the indiscriminate slaughter of the Yellowstone bison. This is the one place the migratory species still roams their native habitat in the United States. The Yellowstone bison are unique, requiring special attention and action, distinguished as the only bison to continuously inhabit their original range in the United States, and comprised of genetically distinct sub-populations, the Central and Northern herds.

The reason I am making this petition (and hoping it blows up) is on behalf of my younger brother. My younger brother is also deaf, and he always asks me, \"What are they saying?\" My brother and I are huge football fans, and while we love the game of football, we also enjoy watching clips and behind-the-scenes. As an individual who can hear, I enjoy watching the NFL Mic'd Up&nbsp;series or the SoundFX clips on YouTube and NFL.com. However, my brother does not get to enjoy these same clips, especially when they are promoted nationwide on social media outlets such as Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and so forth.&nbsp;\nAfter scanning the internet for hours and having no luck in finding videos of the \"NFL Mic'd Up\" with closed-captioning, I have decided to turn to Change.org to help the NFL become more inclusive with the Deaf Community. I tried finding an appropriate contact for the NFL, but I felt like my request would be --unironically-- unheard. The goal is to provide entertainment to football fans, but there is an entire community that is missing out. Now more than ever, there has been a bigger desire to provide equality and equity to individuals who cannot hear on the internet with big media outlets (like NowThisNews) providing closed captioning on their videos so EVERYONE can enjoy it.\nMy brother and I are huge football fans, and it hurts my heart to know that I can enjoy certain things while he can't. For my entire life, I have never deemed myself as \"better,\" and truthfully have never viewed my brother as \"less\" or allowing his disability to limit who he is as an individual. However, this is one area that I want to support him because he deserves to enjoy the same things I get to, and it's truly an easy fix that the NFL can do to make their content more accessible for ALL. Even with YouTube's text to speech option, it is not 100% accurate and I believe that the NFL could easily add closed-captioning to these clips, as well as potentially adding them to other content such as Fantasy Football or regular football clips.\nPlease sign this petition so I can present it to the NFL and provide my family, along with countless other deaf football fans, the benefit of enjoying the same content that I and millions of other football fans enjoy on a daily basis. The NFL is taking strides towards encouraging equality for all, and this goes hand-in-hand in supporting fans who are Deaf, and so my brother can continue to enjoy the same things I can.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/je/re/twjERekWlOUiakO-800x450-noPad.jpg?1603923170"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/law-students-virginia-anti-death-penalty-bill-sb1165?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Virginia Anti-Death Penalty Bill SB1165", "description": "In this new year, we Virginians have the rare chance to effect positive change to our judicial system - a system that has institutionalized inequity and unjust applications of the law against marginalized communities for years. As students of Virginia\u2019s law schools, we take seriously the responsibility to shape our legal system and are compelled to take a stand in the face of institutional failures. This General Assembly session, state legislators will have the opportunity to vote on a House and a Senate bill to abolish capital punishment in Virginia. The death penalty is rooted in systemic racism and reflects our country\u2019s history of oppression and injustice. We, the undersigned, are united in our request that the Virginia General Assembly formally abolish capital punishment during the current session.\nThe year 2020 taught us many lessons, but one was particularly critical: to take a stand for racial justice and to do so loudly - not only advocating for equitable treatment of vulnerable populations, but implementing real change to archaic institutions. The death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent and gives the state the final word on another human\u2019s life. It is rooted in revenge, economically inefficient, and is riddled with racial bias.\nIn Virginia, the death penalty is a remnant of the Jim Crow era. Today, a Black person is seven times more likely to be sentenced to death for a crime than their white counterpart. In addition, only four wealthy suburban jurisdictions (out of 133) have been the driving force behind death penalty sentences since 1982. Equality, justice and uniformity of the law are cornerstones of our judicial system\u2014capital punishment ignores these.\nTo those still in favor of capital punishment, we urge you to reflect on the words of Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative - Stevenson once said that the threshold question for the death penalty should not be \u201cDo people deserve to die for the crimes they have committed?\u201d but rather, \u201cDo we deserve to kill?\u201d In a penal system full of human error, racial bias, class bias, and arbitrary application, the answer to the latter question must be a resounding no.\nWe must acknowledge our past and collectively work towards a better future for our commonwealth. Virginia is second only to Texas in executions since 1976.&nbsp; The era of state-sanctioned vengeance killings can end with us. This month, the Virginia General Assembly has the opportunity to be the first southern state to abolish capital punishment and be an example to the remaining twenty-five states still actively using the death penalty.\nWe, the undersigned Virginia law students, call for an end to capital punishment in Virginia. Staying silent is no longer an option. Now is the time to let our voices be heard.\nSign this petition, call, write, and email your state legislators. Urge them to vote in favor of abolishing capital punishment. Share this petition with five friends and ask them to do the same. Governor Northam has said that he would sign an abolition bill should it appear on his desk. We have never been closer to eradicating the death penalty in Virginia. Our actions in the coming months must reflect the urgency of this opportunity, and what it would mean for the lives of the current two inmates on Virginia\u2019s death row, their families, and future defendants in our commonwealth. This is a question of justice and equity, of attempting to repair a broken system and fix the wrongs of our past. Demonstrate your support by signing this petition and help put an end to the death penalty.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/yw/wj/mkYwwjvlXtVKmtF-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610487954"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/twitter-inc-twitter-and-facebook-permanently-ban-donald-trump?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Twitter and Facebook: Permanently Ban Donald Trump", "description": "After Donald Trump used social media to incite an armed insurrection and domestic terrorist attack on the United States Capitol, his continued presence on Twitter and Facebook is a clear and present danger.&nbsp;\nWhile it is commendable that Twitter and Facebook temporarily suspended Trump from their platforms on Wednesday, these suspensions must become permanent bans. \nSince Twitter lifted Trump\u2019s suspension, he has started to again use the platform to encourage violence and to spread dangerous disinformation.&nbsp;There will be plenty of time to debate whether Twitter and Facebook should have taken away Trump\u2019s social media accounts sooner, yet his continued access puts tens of millions of Americans at imminent risk of harm.&nbsp;\nWe implore Twitter and Facebook to do the right thing and permanently ban Donald Trump.

He had no history of violence, and provided employment to a lot of people that others had turned their backs on. To date, Mr. Blalock sits in jail, while the true killer(s) continue to live life freely. Mr. Blalock was framed for this crime due to unrequited love coupled with vindictive prosecution.

A beautiful location with many outdoor activities. We have a gorgeous lake, exceptional trails, winter activities, and incredible landscape just to name a few.

It will create a safe, fun, and friendly environment for our children and adults that enjoy skateboarding, roller blading, scootering and BMX riding. This park will encourage people of all ages to get outside, exercise, and&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;one of the worlds most popular hobbies. A public skatepark will be a viable addition to give our local youth a safe place to enjoy skating rather than having to rely on busy streets and shopping centers. Lastly, a skatepark will keep our children active, and give them an environment&nbsp;to spend time with friends and family in an outdoor setting.&nbsp;If this petition is approved, we believe this local skatepark will benefit our already growing community.

This notification came from superintendent, Dr. Dan Shelton, based on the recommendation of Governor John Carney.&nbsp;\nWe demand that all schools within the Christina School District remain in the Remote Instruction model until the daily new cases within New Castle County trend below 100 for a 2 week average.&nbsp;\nBased on the current data, Delaware had 1,241 new positive cases on January 6, 2021. Percent of people testing positive stood at 28% and percent of tests positivity presented at 9.9%. There are currently 453 hospitalizations, 57 critical. In addition to these numbers, the State of Delaware dismantled the School Safety Dashboard which cited the parameters used for community safety. Prior to its deletion, the criteria stated that once the state reached a rolling average of 8% test positivity, schools would implement remote learning only to limit community spread. Upon Governor Carney\u2019s announcement on January 5th, the dashboard ceased to exist and a new dashboard named In-Person Contagious School Cases took its place. There are no longer any state mandated criteria to guide the safety of community spread within schools.&nbsp;\nDPH does not offer \u201cschools\u201d as a venue where infection could have occurred for contact tracing purposes. Therefore, there is no valid data proving that schools are not an environment where COVID-19 is spread. In addition, in New Castle County,&nbsp; the number of cases per 10,000 people for ages 5-17 is 452.5. This data proves that children do indeed get the virus and are able to spread. Since our students are maskless for both breakfast and lunch, it is impossible to guarantee safety to those around them.&nbsp;\nMaintaining remote instruction not only provides a consistent schedule for our youth, but also limits exposures within the community. It allows for a 5 day a week equitable education and ensures not one staff member or student&nbsp; is exposed inside a Christina School District building to a potentially fatal virus.

We were blessed to have incredible talent like Patti Murin as Anna, Caissie Levy as Elsa, Jelani Alladin as Kristoff, John Riddle as Hans, Greg Hildreth as Olaf, and so many wonderful men and women who encompassed both the supporting characters and ensemble of this amazing show.The story, sets, songs, and characters took on a whole new dimension as it was brought to life on stage, and as Olaf so eloquently put it, \"Some things are worth melting for.\" I was lucky to see this show twice on Broadway with much of the original cast, and it was truly a magical experience.Like so many fans, we were saddened by the departure of much of the original cast in early 2020 but were excited and hopeful by the incoming talent of great actors who would replace Patti Murin and Caissie Levy as Anna and Elsa. McKenzie Kurtz and Ciara Ren\u00e9e would take on the roles with grace, energy, and passion as the original leading ladies have done for the past two years (including their out of town tryouts in Denver, CO). Also joining these ladies was Ryan McCartan (well-known from Liv &amp; Maddie and Wicked), and they officially had their first Broadway performances on 18 February 2020. (I would also like to mention that Noah J. Ricketts and Ryann Redmond were promoted to their respective roles as Kristoff and Olaf after Jelani Alladin and Greg Hildreth left the show in 2019.)Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and Broadway was shut down on 12 March 2020.Ms. Kurtz, Ms. Ren\u00e9e, and Mr. McCartan only had the opportunity to play Anna, Elsa, and Hans for roughly three weeks. Much of the cast and crew were keeping their fingers crossed that they would be able to return to the show once the pandemic was over. Then, a dark day came for Frozen fans across the country on 14 May 2020. Disney announced that Frozen would not be returning to Broadway when the pandemic ended.I was crushed, to say the least, along with hundreds, even millions, of others who had the chance to see this show more than once or hadn't even seen the show at all. What was especially heartbreaking was that Ms. Kurtz's Broadway debut was cut so drastically short by the pandemic, and many of the actors and crew members associated with the show are now out of work.Disney had the opportunity to do a filmed stage version of the award-winning Broadway version of Newsies in 2017 with Jeremy Jordan, Kara Lindsay, Andrew Keenan Bolger, Ben Frankhauser, and Tommy Bracco reprising their roles from the original Broadway show. It was a hit among fans of the show and continues to be enjoyed by individuals of all ages. And who could forget releasing the filmed stage version of Hamilton with the original Broadway cast on Disney+ to resounding fanfare in 2020?What's to stop Disney from doing a filmed stage version of Frozen?

Plus, it would inspire a new generation of fans to go see live theatre if Frozen the Musical was filmed and made accessible to audiences across the country and the world.Please consider making a filmed stage version of Frozen the Musical with Mckenzie Kurtz, Ciara Ren\u00e9e, Ryan McCartan, and the rest of the most recent Broadway cast reprising their roles before the pandemic shut down the show for good.

I went to one semester of culinary classes and obtained my ServSafe Food Protection Managers Certification Examination, which is accredited by The American National Standards Institute(ANSI)- Conference for Food Protection (CFP) on September 28. When my family and friends started sharing and posting on social media my cakes and cupcakes, word spread and soon, I had people asking me to bake them special cakes and desserts. During this time, I was also in the process of researching what it takes to get a business license and purchasing a business name. I created a business page on Facebook and thought it was going well.\nOn the night of, January 12, I received a letter from the Monroe County Health Department stating there was a complaint filed against me and I had to cease operation of my food service immediately. On January 13, I researched the \u201cCottage Food Act\u201d and the \u201cCupcake Act\u201d. The Cottage Food Act states that I cannot make more than $25,000 per year, allowed to bake out of my private kitchen but only selling my desserts at a Farmers Market. The Cupcake Act was enacted in ONLY eight out of 102 counties in Illinois - Monroe County NOT being one of those eight. The Cupcake Act was put in place 2014 by a 12-year old girl from Troy, IL. This Act allows bakers to bake and sell out of their home kitchen as long as they inform their customers that their kitchen has not been inspected. It also states that I can only make less than $1,000 in gross profit per month. Since a Farmers Market only runs during warm weather (May through October), how would I be able to sell my product - I can\u2019t. And since Monroe County has not enacted the Cupcake Act, I still cannot sell my beautiful cakes and desserts.

The neighborhood of Kensington in the city of Philadelphia is the epicenter of America\u2019s Opioid crisis. In 1992, after lobbying efforts by the members of PPP, Mayor Ed Rendell issued an Executive Order (4-92), legalizing the possession of syringes in Philadelphia. The reasoning behind the executive order was to help control the spread of HIV/AIDS &amp; &nbsp;Hepatitis. Addicts are permitted to obtain a bag of drug paraphernalia which contains; &nbsp;cotton swabs, crack pipes, needles and much more. These items are supposed to be returned to the center from where they picked it up, in order for them to receive another sterile bag of drug paraphernalia. Unfortunately, the reality is, a high number of the items distributed are not collected nor discarded properly by the center if at all. The addict population whom, the majority of, are not residents, leave paraphernalia all over the neighborhood. Public parks, playgrounds, private property, store fronts, which are all plagued by used needles to the point where children can not play safely and many mothers are forced to make the decision of whether or not to even allow their children to wear open toe shoes through the neighborhood; due to fear of their child being poked by a syringe. Tragically, there have been one too many cases where children are forced to get medical treatment not only for the needle stick injury, but also, emergency medication called Trivacy and Truveda within 24 hours of the incident. This to be followed by multiple visits, lab work and in severe instances, treatment for the stress and anxiety that accompanies this type of traumatic experience. The medication itself totals over $2000 in out of pocket expenses. How can residents already living below the poverty level afford this required medical treatment? Why are residents forced to pick up used drug paraphernalia that an organization gets paid to distribute and properly dispose of. During one clean up event The Kensington Beach organization collected a total 873 used needles in McPherson Park which holds the community\u2019s only local library. No children should be subjected to these living conditions. Please join us in signing the petition to enforce Pennsylvania State Law in Philadelphia to stop the needle exchange program.

I spent my summer training a stellar 3 Year Old 17.2hh Thoroughbred x Morgan Gelding that blew the socks off any Warmblood I've ever ridden. It is so unfortunate that he will never be registered, unless presented to the American Warmblood Registry.&nbsp;Most \"Warmblood\" people unfortunately hardly recognize this Registry as legitimate. At the end of the Summer, I was so inspired by this cross, that I selected three off-track Thoroughbred mares that I brought home and bred to my Full Lippitt Morgan stallions.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThis is not the first cross though that I have encountered that took the breath away of passerbys, and were horses remembered for a lifetime by the people that owned them. Moriesian, Morab and Quarter Horse crosses are a few examples of the breeds who have been blessed by the blood of the Morgan. These horses were never accepted into any special showring-- even to compete among each other as what they were, all descendants of the breed we love dearly -- the Morgan Horse. This is something I would like to change.\n&nbsp;\nI believe that with an AMHA endorsed Part Morgan Registry, it would promote the Morgan to many outsiders of the breed. I believe this Registry could be operated much like the Arabian Horse Association operates its' Part Bred and Anglo-Arabian Registry. Special classes could be held, bringing higher turnout to shows. It would help the Morgan appeal to the ever growing Sporthorse market and help the breed grow and perpetuate for generations to come.\n&nbsp;\nIt may take time to develop, and get its' feet off the ground. I believe, given a fair chance though, that the AMHA will never turn back. Within my neighborhood in the small rural town of which I live, I know of six half Morgan offspring just waiting for the opportunity to join a Registered family of horses! This is not including neighboring towns, with numerous babies from non-Morgan mares our Morgan stallions bred by request of those in awe of his Morgan traits.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nFigure stamped the mares he was crossed on, it was what he was known for. This is how we have the Morgan we do today. Every Morgan we love and own descended from that very special horse owned&nbsp; by Justin Morgan himself. Are these beautiful half-bred Morgans any different? Are they not descendants as well of Figure? I believe they deserve their recognition as such; recognizing these horse will only help the breed grow and perpetuate. Allowing this Registry would prevent the adulteration of the pure Morgan ancestors to these crosses. People can have a Saddlebred type Morgan, a Warmblood type Morgan, a Quarter Horse type Morgan-- by having their crosses recognized and not changing the breed itself. Morgan horses across the globe continue to stamp their Morgan traits to this day.

This was not a case of a \u201cdesk rejection,\u201d where an editor decides that a book does not have academic merit or does not achieve the marketing goals of the press: Coup had received glowing peer reviews, and a publication contract with NUS Press had already been signed (on August 29, 2019). The book had been designed and was even available for pre-order online. Instead, what Mr. Schoppert related to Dr. Pavin was that \u201cstakeholders within and outside the university community\u201d had exerted their influence to cancel the book\u2019s publication. The decision was sudden, opaque, and out of keeping with good academic practices.\nThis is a clear violation of academic freedom. Academic presses base their decisions to publish or not on the academic merit of the works involved, and on the peer reviews that scholars in the field provide. Indeed, as a testament to Coup\u2019s merit, it was readily accepted and is now published by Yale Southeast Asia Studies. Academic presses should not be beholden to political pressure, either from within the university or from other actors. NUS Press has been in the past a valuable resource, especially for scholars in and of Southeast Asia. Its deference to unnamed \u201cstakeholders within and outside the university\u201d is disturbing to say the least and calls into question the reputation and independence of the Press.\nWe are calling for a moratorium on reviewing new manuscripts for NUS Press, for five years. This is for a number of reasons. We feel that a boycott of NUS Press books would only hurt the scholars who have in the past published with the Press. Additionally, NUS Press cannot reverse its decision on Coup; the book has a happy home now at Yale. But we cannot have faith in NUS Press\u2019s independence and commitment to academic freedom moving forward. It is a sad day indeed when a university press that has served the academic world so well acts so cravenly in response to anonymous pressure. It sets a dangerous precedent that the directors of other presses will have good reason to fear. We hope that NUS Press will carry out a public inquiry staffed by independent observers as the one way to reassure the academic world that it is interested in regaining its hitherto stellar reputation.

The current plan includes a 0.34 mile gap in pedestrian access which prevent safe passage of students to the schools.&nbsp;\nWhites Road, in Fort Mill, SC, is located between the Fort Mill Bypass and the Waterside at the Catawba neighborhood. It is home to the entrance to 2 area schools \u2013 Catawba Ridge High School and, as of fall 2020, Forest Creek Middle School. This road is 1 mile long. The middle school spans almost the entirety of the first 0.40 miles after the Dominion Bridge neighborhood. &nbsp;Then there is a 0.34 mile stretch of road with no margin for pedestrians. There is one private residence on this stretch of land, and the rest is land associated with the power lines. Next follows &nbsp;0.30 miles of side-walked road outside the neighborhoods of Pecan Ridge and Waterside at the Catawba.\nThere are hundreds of students that live in the neighborhoods off Whites Road \u2013 all are no more than 2 miles from the schools \u2013 easily bikeable and even walk friendly for many students. However, it is impossible to get to the schools due to the 0.34 miles stretch of road with no area for pedestrians. &nbsp;This forces our students take a bus or car to school. Traffic in the area is already a problem and inevitably will get worse with the opening of the new school. We want the option for students to walk to school \u2013 taking cars and buses off the road. This will also provide a safe roadway for sports teams to run on and area residents to exercise.\nWe understand that this road is a state road, and there is no transportation improvement funds to solve this problem. Thus, we are requesting pedestrian access between Forest Creek and the neighborhoods as part of the existing budget for Forest Creek Middle School. We request this to be completed by the opening of the school in fall 2020. We understand that the road is scheduled to be widened in the next decade and new sidewalks will be put in at that time; however, hundreds of students need to get to school now. Any money put toward a pedestrian walkway is not wasted. It is an investment in the traffic situation for our area, a reduction of cost in busing, and a step towards our community living a more active lifestyle.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/mn/zh/fdMNZHxXhUKorVh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605305852"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/target-stop-hartz-products-from-hurting-and-killing-dogs?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "STOP HARTZ PRODUCTS FROM KILLING AND INJURING OUR PETS!", "description": "Precious Jack died on New Years Eve 2020 just hours after a flea bath with this shampoo.

During the fiscal year 19/20, the M.e.t.'s educational outreach program taught over 181,000 children and adults about sustainability, composting, and curbside and drop-off recycling. The M.e.t. also operates 10 recycling centers in 8 member communities and employs 75 individuals with disabilities. These workers brighten the lives of all those who visit the recycling centers with their warm welcomes and smiles. The environmental services and education the M.e.t. provides are invaluable to Tulsa citizens and surrounding communities.\nThe Tulsa Authority for the Recovery of Energy (TARE) wishes to remove two of the Tulsa drop-off recycling centers and reduce funding for the M.e.t.'s educational outreach program. By removing the East Tulsa center (2160 S Garnett Rd, Tulsa, OK 74129) and the Downtown Tulsa center (1101 S Cincinnati Ave, Tulsa, OK 74119), the only available drop-off recycling center in the Tulsa area would be the Central Tulsa location off 34th and Sheridan. This would greatly impact Tulsa citizens access to recycling services. Keeping all three drop-off recycling centers open in Tulsa is important because:\n\nThe M.e.t. makes recycling accessible for apartment dwellers and those in multi-family housing. This population is not able to use the recycling services provided by the City.\nThe M.e.t. accepts materials that are not recyclable through Tulsa's curbside program, such as electronics, batteries, grocery bags, cooking oil, and motor oil.&nbsp;\nThe M.e.t. provides recycling services to a large and growing number of citizens in the East Tulsa and Downtown areas.\nThe M.e.t. produces educational materials for member governments, Tulsa area citizens, schools, and non-profits and also provides hands-on environmental education in classrooms and after-school programs.\n\nThe M.e.t. provides environmental services and education that the City of Tulsa does not have the capacity to fill. Citizens in the Downtown Tulsa and East Tulsa communities will be without reasonable access to recycling services if TARE removes the two drop-off recycling centers in these communities. Moreover, contamination rates in curbside programs will likely increase if citizens do not have easy access to centers where they are able to drop-off items that are not accepted in the curbside containers. This may cause less materials to be recycled because contaminated recycling will go to the landfill. Reducing funding for educational programming will also negatively impact the M.e.t.'s ability to promote environmental stewardship and provide children and adults with high quality environmental education.\nPlease consider signing this petition and contacting your city council member and/or the TARE board to express your support for the M.e.t. and keeping Tulsa green!\nTARE contact:&nbsp;\nJenna EvansTARE Secretary2445 S.

A threat exists today that would demolish the original Little Singer School (est. 1976) in Birdsprings, Arizona on the Navajo Nation. This first of its kind school was the dream of Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed (Little Singer), a powerful Din\u00e9 medicine man, and was the design of Thomas Ryan Sr., a physicist from northern California. The dream was to halt the forced removal of Dine children to far off residential schools.\nMy family and I are originally from Birdsprings, Arizona, and our maternal clan is T\u00f3d\u00edch\u2019\u00ed\u00ednii. We come to you today to humbly ask for your help in saving the original Little Singer School in Birdsprings, Arizona on the Navajo Nation. The name of the school carries the legacy of Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed, Little Singer, who is remembered for his knowledge of Din\u00e9 ceremonies, prayer songs, wisdom, generosity, and kindness. Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed\u2019s innovative thinking, especially with regards to the welfare of the Birdsprings community allowed for his vision for the betterment of his people.&nbsp;\nIn 1970 he befriended my stepfather, Thomas Ryan Sr.,&nbsp; who was living at Rincon Ranch in Winslow, Arizona. Although Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed only spoke Navajo and Ryan only spoke English, they often visited and conversed and soon a friendship blossomed. It was Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed\u2019s concern for the future of his people that led to the vision of building a school \u201cto bring the children home.\u201d Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed was aware of an unnatural deafening silence due to the absence of children in Birdsprings. Ryan learned from his Navajo friends that the U.S. Federal Government\u2019s Indian education policy was to separate children from their families for nine months out of the year to attend Federal Indian Boarding Schools. Therefore, he wholeheartedly accepted Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed\u2019s request to build a community school, where the curriculum would incorporate the Din\u00e9 language and culture.&nbsp;\nBeginning in the early 1970\u2019s Thomas Ryan Sr. designed the iconic red geodesic domes and an \u201cA-frame\u201d building that comprised the original school. The geodesic shape was built for strength and longevity, as well as, to mimic the form of the traditional Navajo hogan. Since no electrical lines existed in Birdsprings at the time, two wind generators provided the electricity for the school; and solar panels harnessed the sun\u2019s energy to heat the school. Through prayers offered by Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed, the steadfast efforts of the Birdsprings community, and Ryan\u2019s ingenuity, the Little Singer School opened in 1979. It was the first sustainable school on the Navajo Reservation. The education received at Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed Bi\u2019O\u0142ta, Little Singer School, enabled one to read and write in the Din\u00e9 language, to sing social and prayer songs in Navajo, and to learn about the Din\u00e9 culture and history from elders.&nbsp;\nAlthough my family and I are happy that a new school is built, we do not want the original school to be demolished.

This piece of proposed legislation, introduced by State Rep. Wes Allen (R), seeks to prohibit medications that block or delay puberty for transgender individuals aged 18 years and younger whose gender assigned at birth is incongruent with their experienced gender. As transgender (trans) individuals and parents of trans youth who have experienced the medically recognized condition known as gender dysphoria from an early age, we speak on this matter as experts. We have first-hand knowledge of the challenges that a trans individual faces when they are forced to transition later in life due to not having access to medications prescribed by medical professionals who specialize in trans care. Having access to both mental health professionals as well as physicians whose therapies can delay the onset of puberty allows trans youth to receive ongoing counseling and the ability to seek and examine the individual they authentically are. Such services may be defined as nothing short of lifesaving. The services and pharmaceuticals that are the subject of this misguided bill merely pause the onset of a dysphoria-inducing puberty in order for a young trans person to make personal decisions with the support from&nbsp;parent/guardian and supervised by medical and mental health professionals.\nWe do not stand alone in our opposition to VCCPA. Our position is shared in whole or in part by the American Pediatrics Association, the American Medical Association, ACLU and many others (including more than 200 medical professionals who signed an open letter last year opposing these type of bills here in the south and nationwide). The population of trans youth already face a multitude of challenges, not least among which are numerous health disparities. Young people who identify as transgender or gender diverse (TGD) would be irreparably and permanently harmed by the VCCPA. It is devoid of either the \u201ccompassion\u201d or \u201cprotection\u201d its title purports to espouse; instead,&nbsp; it will irreparably infringe upon the rights of transgender youth and that of their families to seek specialized treatment and care as described and endorsed by the American Pediatrics Association and other medical groups.&nbsp;\nTrans youth, as well as the trans community as a whole, continue to face disparities that stem from multiple sources, including inequitable laws and policies, societal discrimination, and a lack of access to consistent, quality healthcare. This is equally or even more intense for trans youth who do not conform to social expectations and norms regarding gender. The best estimates suggest that nearly 1.4 million adults in just the United States identify as transgender or gender non-conforming and that almost 2% of youth ages 13-18 personally identify as transgender. In Alabama there are approximately 1.67 million high school age young people. Statistics indicate that some 33,000 of them may identify as transgender. These trans youth consistently face extremely high rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, non-lethal self-harm, and suicide. We find 56% of youth who identify as transgender reported previous suicidal ideation and&nbsp;31% report previous suicide attempts. In Alabama this would equate to 11,000 of our children. Blocking, limiting or forbidding legal access to trans care for youth will almost certainly&nbsp;increase the risk of harm to general public health and safety. Passage and implementation of this legislation will inexorably lead to the exact opposite of its stated intent as the numbers of trans youth who seek to become who they choose to be are once again told they do not have access to the medical treatments they want and desperately need and therefore resort to less safe approaches to therapy.\nLegislation like the VCCPA bubbles to the surface propelled by antiquated, hysterical anti-trans myths, misconceptions and outright bigotry. One such myth is the inexplicable and un-supported claim that there are people who actively seek to perform surgeries on underage trans teens (including but not limited to gender reassignment). Nothing could be further from the truth. Gender Confirmation Surgery (GCS) is a&nbsp; momentous, consequential procedure and a decision no more appropriate for youths as the process involves an extended period on hormonal replacement therapy (years) and an extended series of counseling sessions by a mental health professional who works with the individual, also usually for many years, before making a decision to proceed with any type of surgeries as an adult. Even as an adult, professional certification of stable mental health, as well as medical health most often is required in order to undergo these types of procedures. Rep. Allen and others who support this type of discriminatory legislation appear to labor under the mind-boggling misconception there is a hidden agenda or secret national movement to promote gender reassignment surgeries in youth and that the medications that aide youth in making life choices, as guided by parents and mental health professionals, are harmful and damaging to their bodies. This is a baseless assertion supported by absolutely no evidence. It is not only non-factual, but ahistorical and un-scientific. In fact, these treatments seek to stabilize the trans youth and provide an alternative to the agonizing 56%&nbsp;of suicidal ideations and the 31% of actual suicidal attempts. How is it \u201ccompassionate\u201d to enact legislation that will certainly immiserate a fragile, marginalized community? The short answer is that is not. Trans people, our youth included, are among the most hated and despised in our nation, and doubtless so in our state and this benighted bill is yet another manifestation of that hatred. Trans youth simply want what any other citizen of the United States and specifically citizens of the Great State of Alabama want: access to quality healthcare and to live freely and authentically.&nbsp;\u201cWe Dare Defend Our Rights\u201d applies equally to our trans siblings wherever in Alabama they may be.\nWe are at a time in our nation in which we see systemic racism, anti-semitism, separatism, and a general breakdown of our society as a whole, both politically and morally. None of this is the fault of the trans community, young or old. We urge you to reject out-of-hand as harmful and hurtful the provisions of the VCCPA by voting it down. In doing so you will take a stand for the thousands of youth of our State and many other States who already face multifarious discriminations for simply living their lives. Their discrimination must not be endorsed and advanced by their elected representatives. Individual rights are the essential foundation of our democracy. Too often we see government over-reach their mandate, telling others how to live,&nbsp;worship, or exist. Let us not allow H.B. 303 to put our state again on the wrong side of history. We implore you to reject the VCCPA.\nPlease join us in giving these youth a voice. One that says, yes we are different, yes we are non-conforming, but are we not also equal in the eyes of the law as any other youth that would seek other types of medical treatments? We are also creative, community oriented, talented and well educated members of society that deserve to have our government recognize us as more than second class citizens. It was Martin Luther King Jr. who reminded us that&nbsp;\u201cIt may well be that we will have to repent in this generation. Not merely for the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around and say, \"Wait on time.\u201d In summation trans kids have the same rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as any other American citizen.\nWe thank you for your time and consideration in&nbsp;this matter and we make&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;continuously available to present any materials or answer any questions, including directly from transgender youth in our Alabama community and many from around the country who stand to join us in these&nbsp;efforts in discharging&nbsp;discriminatory legislation as the VCCP Act before you now.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/gs/cl/bKgsclcDRShwXju-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610497233"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/j-b-pritzker-reduce-sentence-for-man-excessively-sentenced-as-a-teenager?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Reduce Sentence for Man Excessively Sentenced as a Teenager", "description": "At age 19, Michael Hill was sentenced excessively for 3rd degree murder- despite acting out of self defense.

The dance depicts police brutality against Black people through movement and projected text that said \u201cEvery human should have the right to\u2026\u201d followed by some of the reasons Black people have been the targets of police violence including \u201csleep peacefully\u201d, and \u201csurvive a traffic violation.\u201d\nOn Thursday, December 10th, the Dean of the College of Fine Arts and Production told the director of the dance department that the projected text had to be removed from the piece. Although disappointed and angry, we agreed to perform the piece without the projector.\nOn Friday, December 11th, the opening night of our concert, we were told that an entire section of the dance where dancers fell to the ground to depict the loss of Black lives had to be removed as well.&nbsp;\nAfter hearing this news, the cast of the piece met to organize a peaceful protest where instead of performing the censored version of the dance, we stood on stage as the music played while holding signs that said what the projected text was going to say.

No release for Robert Mentz!", "description": "Hello, my name is Tiffany. On September 18th, my sister Brandi Garcia was murdered by her boyfriend, Robert Mentz. She was run over by him more than once and in front of her two young children, 8 and 9 years old, as well as our father, Charles. Her murder was horrific. My family could not even view her, as she was completely crushed in the incident. Robert Mentz is fighting his case, by saying he accidentally ran her over, when the damage to her body tells a more devastating tale. Homicide detectives have dropped the ball dramatically, by not handling her case in a more serious manner. They have failed to reach out to us when promised, and even the DA on my sister's case has attempted to get them to reach out to us. As we have requested her belongings and some reason to the lesser charges and incident details that they seem to have left out, as her children and our father are victims to this vicious attack against, Robert Mentz. We just got word yesterday, 1/13/20, that Robert Mentz attorney is requesting a new judge to hear his case, in an attempt to be released until trial. My family is terrified! Robert Mentz is a know Domestic abuser and even fled Colorado, due to open Domestic Violence and child endangerment charges, as well as having an open restraining order issued in the state from a previous girlfriend. He knows where we live. He is a dangerous man and will do this again if he is given the opportunity. Not only does my sister Brandi Garcia deserve justice, her children and our family deserve to feel safe as well, as our lives, especially the children, have been forever changed. Rovert Mentz is a monster who has proven time and again that he is a dangerous man. Our community will not be safe if Robert Mentz is released! Please be a voice in this cause. Protect your Mother, Daughter, Sister, Friend from Domestic Violence. Enough is enough!&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/9/wi/os/qBwIosZeBgPQihc-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610676920"}]}
