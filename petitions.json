Johnson was 1/3 crack cocaine dealers who was convicted in 1992, for a string of murders that claimed 10 lives in a 45-day period. Prosecutor\u2019s have stated that he killed 7 people, in an attempt to expand gang-territory in Richmond, Virginia. HOWEVER Johnson is intellectually disabled, and after a 2002 Virginia case, the Supreme Court ruled it unlawful to execute a person who is of \u201csuch low intelligence that they can\u2019t function in society\u201d. Also, NO jury or court has listened to the evidence that his lawyers have presented to decide whether or not Johnson has an intellectual disability. Allowing Cory Johnson\u2019s execution to go forward will be a GRAVE INJUSTICE.</p>\n<p>Johnson suffered a HORRIBLE, childhood, filled with mental, physical, and emotional abuse, along with neglect (which are all risk factors for intellectual disabilities). At 13 he was abandoned by his drug-addict mother to a residential facility for children with intellectual &amp; emotional impairments, because he could not learn, and she was not able to cope his limitations. He transferred from numerous schools, and homes until 18 where we was released from a similar facility, with zero life skills, no life structure/support, and overall a little to no chance at succeeding at life. There has been any other federal death penalty prisoner who has NEVER had a single evidentiary hearing in which they could present their intellectual disability evidence. Johnson\u2019s execution should not proceed in the absence of fair &amp; thorough opportunity to present his evidence. Three experts in intellectual disability have also concluded that there is an OVERWHELMING amount of evidence to PROVE that Johnson IS intellectually disabled. Also, Johnson\u2019s co-defendant Vernon Thomas, who was convicted of the same violent acts as Johnson (including 4 murders), was spared the death penalty because of his own intellectual disability.Mind y\u2019all, there has NOT been a lame duck execution in the transition period since 1888-1889. Now under the Trump Administration, there will be 3+.</p>\n<p>I believe that Cory Johnson deserves to face punishment for what he\u2019s done. HOWEVER I do NOT support him being put to death.

Named <em>Operation Shelter to Home</em>, the city of San Diego converted two of the city\u2019s major events centers, the San Diego Convention Center (SDCC) and the Golden Hall, into shelters for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. There are now plans in place to <strong>close down the shelter</strong> (currently covering 1200+ individuals) at the SDCC on <strong>December 31st, 2020</strong>. We, the Mustard Seed Project, along with our fellow community members and concerned San Diegans, believe that this decision was not made in the best interest of our community. This shelter at the SDCC has proven to be extraordinarily successful in the ways it has supported our city and the people who make it America\u2019s Finest City.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The initial reason SDCC was explicitly chosen to be used as a shelter is due to its <strong>large occupant capacity</strong> and <strong>physical space for social distancing</strong>. Most other shelters in San Diego are currently operating at half capacity, with hardly enough space to social distance (Shelter beds at Newton Ave. are only 3 feet apart). Our community was able to come together and collaborate with one another to provide the safest streamlined services to support our unsheltered community. With help from Father Joe\u2019s Village, The Alpha Project, and Veteran\u2019s Village of San Diego, the SDCC was able to provide not only basic needs like food, showers, bathrooms, laundry services, and sanitary living spaces but able to go above and beyond in its mental and behavioral health services as well as daily health screenings. Furthermore, the coordination of numerous homeless services in a single location has also proved to be immensely successful. Since its inception in April, we have seen a collaborative effort to centralize services like SSI, State ID, and many others. <strong>This consolidation of resources has more than proven its effectiveness, resulting in over 700 housing vouchers, 332 permanent supportive housing units created, and numerous other successes.</strong></p>\n<p><em>In light of the pandemic, widespread economic crisis, the winter season, and the need for continued progress, we make the following demands:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Keep the Operation Shelter to Home shelter open at the San Diego Convention Center until San Diego is able to reach the Yellow Tier for a minimum of 5 weeks.</strong></em> It is unconscionable to close Operation Shelter to Home at the Convention Center while the fatal threat of COVID-19 is only increasing.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Increase funding for social workers, permanent supportive housing, and expanding access to sanitation.</strong></em> In order to best support our community, our supportive services, local grassroots organizations, and resource providers need access to adequate funding so that they can best support our city.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Image Credits: <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/2020/nov/12/san-diego-city-college-class-trains-homeless-servi/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.kpbs.org/news/2020/nov/12/san-diego-city-college-class-trains-homeless-servi/</a></p>", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/cf/tu/ThcFTUyZjzKlgoh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606126070"}, {"title": "Remove Cory Johnson from Death Row and Prevent His Scheduled Execution", "description": "<p>On November 20th, Attorney General William Barr scheduled the execution of Cory Johnson at the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/executions-scheduled-inmates-convicted-brutal-murders-many-years-ago#:~:text=Johnson's%20execution%20initially%20was%20scheduled,Complex%2C%20Terre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this press release</a>.</p>\n<p>Johnson's attorneys, Ronald J.

Sri Lanka committed the 21st century\u2019s most heinous acts of genocide in the final phase of the war in 2008 and 2009.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We call upon the United Nations and its Member States to:</p>\n<p>1. Firmly and unequivocally pass a time-bound resolution at the 46th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council mandating an <strong>international, impartial and independent investigation</strong> into the conduct of the Sri Lankan state and its occupying military during the final phase of the war, and into the ongoing acts of genocide and human rights violations</p>\n<p>2. Pass a resolution at the UN Security Council and/or General Assembly that is similar to the above resolution but additionally refers Sri Lanka to the<strong> International Criminal Court (ICC)&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>3. Act swiftly to severely punish those found responsible for <strong>acts of genocide or other abuses</strong>, and to instate a <strong>protection mechanism</strong> that will prevent a recurrence of genocide.</p>\n<p>We make this request noting that:</p>\n<p>1. The Sri Lankan state and its security forces stand accused of <strong>committing genocide against Eelam Tamils</strong>, and also of committing crimes against humanity, war crimes and numerous human rights violations against Eelam Tamils (<a href=\"https://www.justiceforeelam.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see here</a>);</p>\n<p>2. Some of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst atrocities were committed in 2009, when tens of thousands of Eelam Tamil civilians were massacred in a <strong>premeditated genocide</strong> with Sri Lanka deliberately understating the Tamil civilian population in the war zone (claiming 70,000, not 429,000, lived there) before cutting off food and medicine, and then obliterating the small patch where these hundreds of thousands of civilians had sought refuge, although the Sri Lankan government admitted that only a few hundred LTTE fighters lived there (<a href=\"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/737299?ln=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see here)</a>;</p>\n<p>3. <strong>146,679 Eelam Tamil civilians</strong> are as yet unaccounted for, after the last phase of the war, many having gone missing after being seized by Sri Lankan security forces (<a href=\"https://www.tamilnet.com/img/publish/2011/01/LLRCsubmission_by_MannaarDiocese.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see here</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=33380\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>);</p>\n<p>4. Nearly <strong>12 years</strong> have passed since the above acts of genocide during which time no tangible progress has been made towards an independent investigation into the Sri Lankan security forces\u2019 conduct, and the passage of time has assisted Sri Lanka to cover up its atrocities by destroying the evidence;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. In the last 12 years, Sri Lankan security forces have enjoyed <strong>total impunity</strong> and the Sri Lankan state has evaded accountability, setting a dangerous precedent for future acts of genocide not only in Sri Lanka but also, elsewhere;</p>\n<p>6. Acts of genocide <strong>continue to the present day</strong> with Eelam Tamils being targeted for abuses such as <strong>rape</strong>,<strong> destructive conditions of life</strong> (especially amongst the internally displaced), <strong>ethnocide</strong> and <strong>systematic ethnic cleansing</strong> of Tamils from their lands;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. The<strong> Nazi-type motivation for genocide</strong> (ideology that Sinhala people are a \u2018chosen people\u2019 and therefore superior, and Sri Lanka is their \u2018promised land\u2019 and Eelam Tamils a threat), and a supportive state apparatus, could trigger further acts of genocide against Eelam Tamils at any time;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8. Any <strong>internal investigation</strong> of Sri Lanka\u2019s conduct would be inherently <strong>compromised</strong>, as it would be tantamount to a crime\u2019s perpetrator adjudicating on their own innocence;</p>\n<p>9. There can be <strong>no lasting peace or stability </strong>in the region&nbsp;without accountability and redress for the aforementioned international crimes against Eelam Tamil civilians.</p>\n<p><em>This petition has been put forth and spearheaded by the next generation of the Tamil diaspora.

He acted like he hadn\u2019t been giving a good scratch\u2019n in a very very long time. His (log) chain was attached to an old gate put up by my grandfather a long time ago, And he had about 10ft of space to roam.

A year later Craffey agreed to a plea bargain of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 15 years offered by the District Attorney.&nbsp; Corinne\u2019s mother reluctantly agreed to the plea deal because she did not want to put her family, especially Courtney now being 14 years old&nbsp; through a long drawn out trial which would relive all the pain and anguish. She believed there was no way anyone would grant parole for such a horrific crime.</p>\n<p>To release a monster like this into the public where he would be free to stalk his next victim would be a mistake that only hurts the public. Craffey is not just threat but he is a predator, his prey are small frail women who cannot defend themselves.</p>\n<p>Corinne\u2019s family will never get to see her again, her grandchildren will never get the opportunity to meet her.&nbsp; What Craffey did not only destroyed a family but his acts have and will affect that family for generations. This nightmare will never end for the Comperchio/Flynn family. They repeatedly go before the parole board every few years and relive all the heart breaking details in order to keep this monster behind bars.</p>\n<p>Please sign this petition and help make sure this animal never walks a public street again.

They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door.\"&nbsp; Video evidence shows that nothing of the sort happened.&nbsp; The dozen or so protestors chanted, sang and prayed outside his home, but exhibited no violence, threats or vandalism of any sort.</p>\n<p>4) Sen. Josh Hawley doesn't even live in Missouri.&nbsp; A review of property records shows that the first-term Republican is no longer a Missouri homeowner and that he is registered to vote at his sister\u2019s home in Ozark, MO, while he is in-between homes in the state. He has alternately told the press he is living with his parents in Springfield, MO.</p>\n<p>Hawley owns a $1.3 million house in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., where he spends most of his time with his wife, Erin Hawley, and their three children.</p>\n<p>5) Two separate MO audits found that in Hawley's short tenure as Missouri\u2019s attorney general there were many paperwork and management problems that may have cost taxpayers unnecessary amounts of money.</p>\n<p>Taxpayer-paid staff working in former Attorney General Josh Hawley\u2019s office met with his political consultants, perhaps more than a dozen times, in the months before he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2017.</p>\n<p>Several instances of travel related abuses noted that Hawley used a state vehicle and a driver for some trips without documenting the purpose of the trip. One cited example was that a driver told the auditor that on Dec. 16, 2017, he drove Sen. Hawley and his wife, Erin, to Kansas City for a Chiefs football game.</p>\n<p>6) Former U.S. Sen. John C. Danforth on Thursday, following the domestic terrorist attacks on the U.S. Capitol building, said to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: \"Supporting Josh&nbsp;and trying so hard to get him elected to the Senate was the <em>worst mistake I ever made in my life</em>.

I was really curious how people in prison were feeling during this time in our world. I am currently a junior studying social work, and I was really interested in learning more about criminal justice and the prison system in our country. I sent out a letter introducing myself, and hoped he would write me back. He wrote back immediately, sharing all about his past with an open heart and honest words. We started writing to each other every week, and soon for me it became less about the prison system and more about the cycle of vulnerability people of color experience in our society. His parents weren't exactly always providing support, unfortunately they had struggles of their own- the system had failed them too. He shared with me that when he was thirteen, he was passed around to his uncle because his mom could not take care of him. He had bounced around the foster system, but eventually his uncle offered to have him come stay. He was taught how to sell drugs and make money quickly. He was thirteen. My little brother is fifteen, and I could never imagine him transferring from one temporary family to the next, and then getting a lesson from the main male figure in his life how to make a living, illegally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I believe that Kobe\u2019s bunk bed in prison had his name on it since the day he was born. I believe that the systems we have in place in our society failed him by a large margin. His situation made it clear to me just how privileged I am as a white person in our country. Kobe and I talk every day for an hour. It costs me about $12-$20 per day, but talking to him is like feeling a ray of sunshine after months of clouds. Seeing his face on the tiny grainy video screen is like getting a glimpse into the bright and shiny soul that is within him. Today on our video visit, he closed his eyes and took some deep breaths. He said he was trying hard to have faith, trying to keep his strength, but he wasn\u2019t sure why \u201cthey needed to put me in here for so long.\u201d If prison is supposed to be about rehabilitation, I need to know why this man\u2019s life was taken away from ages 21 to 36. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me how somebody with so much love, care, and incredible ideas is stuck behind a fence where they have to pay outrageous prices for phone calls, work full time to be making less than $1 an hour, isn\u2019t eligible for any financial aid, and sleeps in a room with 100 other men.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kobe dreams of owning a food truck. He wants it to be southern food and he already has the whole thing drawn out and the menu decided. He wants to get his business degree so he can have an advantage when he\u2019s out, as well as expand his knowledge of how to be a successful business owner. Kobe is an amazing artist. He draws this amazing detailed art on the outside of the envelopes he sends me, and recently I had the idea to turn these drawings into stickers to pay for his degree. It blew up and within 3 weeks he made enough to pay for his degree, which was full priced, because prisoners aren\u2019t eligible for any sort of financial assistance.</p>\n<p>His smile could make anyone smile.</p>\n<p>His smile deserves to be seen.</p>\n<p>His smile and his light and his laughter and his joy deserves to be where people can hear him and see him.</p>\n<p>The color of his skin gave him an unfair disadvantage in this lifetime, and the least I can do is get his story heard.</p>\n<p>I have people from all different countries wanting to sign a petition to set Kobe free and get his life started. I don\u2019t want him to have to wait 12 more years to start a food truck. I don\u2019t want him to have to wait 12 more years to see his mom. I don\u2019t want him to have to give away his books because he doesn\u2019t have room under his bunk bed. He gave me his all-inclusive book wishlist the other day. It included titles like, \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d \u201cHistory of African Americans,\u201d \u201cAwaken Your Third Eye,\u201d \"The Science of Everyday Life,\" \u201cHow to Start and Run a Food Truck,\u201d \u201cRumi\u2019s Little Book of Love,\u201d and countless other books that just prove how committed Kobe is to changing his life. He is committed to finding the way and the resources to becoming the best person he can be. He realized that he has options that he didn\u2019t realize he had before. He was taught the only way to make money was by doing so the wrong way. He didn\u2019t realize people would buy his art. He was never told that he was worthy or valid. He was never told that he could do anything he wanted. Nobody ever made that clear, in fact society did just the opposite. His closest circle taught him that he was unworthy: unworthy of success, unworthy of love, unworthy of happiness. He had that drummed into him since he was born, and then was expected to rise up despite the entire world relentlessly pushing him down. 12 more years trapped in prison is not the way for him to get started in his life. He is 23 years old. He is just getting his life started. He now knows what he is capable of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How can I show our state he will contribute more to society than the majority of the American population? He plans on becoming a motivational speaker. He plans on opening a nonprofit resource center for single mothers. He has so many things he wants to do, he draws up plans for them all day long.</p>\n<p>Are we going to make him wait another 12 years to get started? Or will we believe in him now? I am respectfully requesting we make this man\u2019s dreams come alive by granting him clemency. He knows now that there are limitless other paths for him, and he is beyond excited to start living his life and break the relentless cycle of vulnerability.</p>", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/yn/ej/TdYnejVNCfNdtFO-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610082768"}, {"title": "I'm Not Leaving The University of Alabama", "description": "<p>On January 6th, 2021, I attended an event with the President of the United States, Donald J.

He felt misunderstood, as if no one could understand his struggles.</p>\n<p>From our most recent sources, Jacob\u2019s roommate sensed his decline, and reached out to the Tigard police department every single day, for almost a week in hopes they could and would do something to help him. However, they told her they could not do anything to help unless Jacob committed a crime.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jacob\u2019s roommate called every day, for five days with no assistance. On the sixth day, the police were called with allegations of domestic abuse (or it could have been a disturbance) - his roommate did so because remember, they would not come unless Jacob committed a crime. The real reason they were called was for the same reason they were called every day for a week - a mental health crisis. They knew this, the dispatchers told them this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When they arrived Jacob was in his car outside his complex, suffering from a mental health crisis alone. The police approached Jacob\u2019s vehicle and tried to detain him. Jacob did not want to be detained - remember, he is in the midst of a mental health crisis. A struggle for detainment between the police and Jacob ensued, which ended in a police officer shooting Jacob 10+ times, unloading a full clip, killing him. He was only 26 years old, with so much life ahead of him. Police officers have tasers, batons, rubber bullets and mace. What on earth would constitute using a gun in this situation? Jacob loved and cared for everyone, and tried his best to help others even when he himself was struggling so deeply on the inside.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The police reports say he was in possession of a \u201cknife.\u201d But this knife was a pocket knife with a 1.5 inch blade that he would carry on his keychain. This small pocket knife was by law not a deadly weapon, and in no way shape or form did Jacob pose a threat.</p>\n<p>After news of his murder spread, protests and riots ensued within Tigard, Oregon, with hundreds protesting such a gross injustice. The news of Jacob\u2019s murder has been localized, but we are here to spread and disseminate it.</p>\n<p>A mental health crisis cannot equal a death sentence. Police departments and their forced MUST be retrained and there must be protocols in place to assist those who are obviously in need of mental health assistance. Many countries and states such as Colorado have a mental health force that arrives at a mental crisis scene prior to law enforcement, to de-escalate the situation as opposed to what the police did to Jacob. This needs to be instated in every state and county.</p>\n<p>We are not asking for condolences or prayers, we are asking for help - help in getting justice for Jacob in a system that whole heartedly protects the police.
