I know everyone\u2019s still reeling from the death of Brandon Bernard, however there\u2019s another issue! Cory Johnson is scheduled to be killed 6 days before Biden is inaugurated. Johnson was 1/3 crack cocaine dealers who was convicted in 1992, for a string of murders that claimed 10 lives in a 45-day period. Prosecutor\u2019s have stated that he killed 7 people, in an attempt to expand gang-territory in Richmond, Virginia. HOWEVER Johnson is intellectually disabled, and after a 2002 Virginia case, the Supreme Court ruled it unlawful to execute a person who is of \u201csuch low intelligence that they can\u2019t function in society\u201d. Also, NO jury or court has listened to the evidence that his lawyers have presented to decide whether or not Johnson has an intellectual disability. Allowing Cory Johnson\u2019s execution to go forward will be a GRAVE INJUSTICE.\nJohnson suffered a HORRIBLE, childhood, filled with mental, physical, and emotional abuse, along with neglect (which are all risk factors for intellectual disabilities). At 13 he was abandoned by his drug-addict mother to a residential facility for children with intellectual &amp; emotional impairments, because he could not learn, and she was not able to cope his limitations. He transferred from numerous schools, and homes until 18 where we was released from a similar facility, with zero life skills, no life structure/support, and overall a little to no chance at succeeding at life. There has been any other federal death penalty prisoner who has NEVER had a single evidentiary hearing in which they could present their intellectual disability evidence. Johnson\u2019s execution should not proceed in the absence of fair &amp; thorough opportunity to present his evidence. Three experts in intellectual disability have also concluded that there is an OVERWHELMING amount of evidence to PROVE that Johnson IS intellectually disabled. Also, Johnson\u2019s co-defendant Vernon Thomas, who was convicted of the same violent acts as Johnson (including 4 murders), was spared the death penalty because of his own intellectual disability.Mind y\u2019all, there has NOT been a lame duck execution in the transition period since 1888-1889. Now under the Trump Administration, there will be 3+.\nI believe that Cory Johnson deserves to face punishment for what he\u2019s done. HOWEVER I do NOT support him being put to death. Johnson has shown to suffer from intellectual disability, and he deserves the right for a jury to hear so.

Richard Reiger let it be known to a neighbor that he had been sleeping in the same bed as Tayvion and then he notified me about it and that is when I asked my son about what happened about his experiences at these sleepovers.\nTayvion only told me so much but I reported it to the police in late September and he had his forensic interview October 21st. I do not wish to share explicit details but they were not limited to Reiger removing all of his clothing before climbing into the bed and Reiger putting his hands on my son. I later took Tayvion in for a forensic interview in which Tayvion gave more detailed information to the investigators so they know more about the actual assault than myself at this point.\nTayvion has changed drastically and is now a depressed little boy that is now having panic attacks multiple times a week and is always angry.

We demand that the shelter at the SDCC remain open until the decision to close is made in the best interest of ALL San Diegans.&nbsp;\nIn April (2020), the city of San Diego took a historic step in addressing its long-standing homelessness crisis. Named Operation Shelter to Home, the city of San Diego converted two of the city\u2019s major events centers, the San Diego Convention Center (SDCC) and the Golden Hall, into shelters for our neighbors experiencing homelessness. There are now plans in place to close down the shelter (currently covering 1200+ individuals) at the SDCC on December 31st, 2020. We, the Mustard Seed Project, along with our fellow community members and concerned San Diegans, believe that this decision was not made in the best interest of our community. This shelter at the SDCC has proven to be extraordinarily successful in the ways it has supported our city and the people who make it America\u2019s Finest City.&nbsp;\nThe initial reason SDCC was explicitly chosen to be used as a shelter is due to its large occupant capacity and physical space for social distancing. Most other shelters in San Diego are currently operating at half capacity, with hardly enough space to social distance (Shelter beds at Newton Ave. are only 3 feet apart). Our community was able to come together and collaborate with one another to provide the safest streamlined services to support our unsheltered community. With help from Father Joe\u2019s Village, The Alpha Project, and Veteran\u2019s Village of San Diego, the SDCC was able to provide not only basic needs like food, showers, bathrooms, laundry services, and sanitary living spaces but able to go above and beyond in its mental and behavioral health services as well as daily health screenings. Furthermore, the coordination of numerous homeless services in a single location has also proved to be immensely successful. Since its inception in April, we have seen a collaborative effort to centralize services like SSI, State ID, and many others. This consolidation of resources has more than proven its effectiveness, resulting in over 700 housing vouchers, 332 permanent supportive housing units created, and numerous other successes.\nIn light of the pandemic, widespread economic crisis, the winter season, and the need for continued progress, we make the following demands:\n\nKeep the Operation Shelter to Home shelter open at the San Diego Convention Center until San Diego is able to reach the Yellow Tier for a minimum of 5 weeks. It is unconscionable to close Operation Shelter to Home at the Convention Center while the fatal threat of COVID-19 is only increasing.\nIncrease funding for social workers, permanent supportive housing, and expanding access to sanitation.

Sri Lanka committed the 21st century\u2019s most heinous acts of genocide in the final phase of the war in 2008 and 2009.&nbsp;\nWe call upon the United Nations and its Member States to:\n1. Firmly and unequivocally pass a time-bound resolution at the 46th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council mandating an international, impartial and independent investigation into the conduct of the Sri Lankan state and its occupying military during the final phase of the war, and into the ongoing acts of genocide and human rights violations\n2. Pass a resolution at the UN Security Council and/or General Assembly that is similar to the above resolution but additionally refers Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court (ICC)&nbsp;\n3. Act swiftly to severely punish those found responsible for acts of genocide or other abuses, and to instate a protection mechanism that will prevent a recurrence of genocide.\nWe make this request noting that:\n1. The Sri Lankan state and its security forces stand accused of committing genocide against Eelam Tamils, and also of committing crimes against humanity, war crimes and numerous human rights violations against Eelam Tamils (see here);\n2. Some of Sri Lanka\u2019s worst atrocities were committed in 2009, when tens of thousands of Eelam Tamil civilians were massacred in a premeditated genocide with Sri Lanka deliberately understating the Tamil civilian population in the war zone (claiming 70,000, not 429,000, lived there) before cutting off food and medicine, and then obliterating the small patch where these hundreds of thousands of civilians had sought refuge, although the Sri Lankan government admitted that only a few hundred LTTE fighters lived there (see here);\n3. 146,679 Eelam Tamil civilians are as yet unaccounted for, after the last phase of the war, many having gone missing after being seized by Sri Lankan security forces (see here&nbsp;or here);\n4. Nearly 12 years have passed since the above acts of genocide during which time no tangible progress has been made towards an independent investigation into the Sri Lankan security forces\u2019 conduct, and the passage of time has assisted Sri Lanka to cover up its atrocities by destroying the evidence;&nbsp;\n5. In the last 12 years, Sri Lankan security forces have enjoyed total impunity and the Sri Lankan state has evaded accountability, setting a dangerous precedent for future acts of genocide not only in Sri Lanka but also, elsewhere;\n6. Acts of genocide continue to the present day with Eelam Tamils being targeted for abuses such as rape, destructive conditions of life (especially amongst the internally displaced), ethnocide and systematic ethnic cleansing of Tamils from their lands;&nbsp;\n7. The Nazi-type motivation for genocide (ideology that Sinhala people are a \u2018chosen people\u2019 and therefore superior, and Sri Lanka is their \u2018promised land\u2019 and Eelam Tamils a threat), and a supportive state apparatus, could trigger further acts of genocide against Eelam Tamils at any time;&nbsp;\n8. Any internal investigation of Sri Lanka\u2019s conduct would be inherently compromised, as it would be tantamount to a crime\u2019s perpetrator adjudicating on their own innocence;\n9. There can be no lasting peace or stability in the region&nbsp;without accountability and redress for the aforementioned international crimes against Eelam Tamil civilians.\nThis petition has been put forth and spearheaded by the next generation of the Tamil diaspora.

He acted like he hadn\u2019t been giving a good scratch\u2019n in a very very long time. His (log) chain was attached to an old gate put up by my grandfather a long time ago, And he had about 10ft of space to roam.

(Keep in mind it was 38F\u00b0 And raining the first time I saw Boss. He had no water in his water bowl and no food in his food bowl. The only food available to him was a bag of (damp) dry dog food inside the trailer.

Josh Hawley should be immediately EXPELLED from the U.S. Senate.&nbsp; He has violated his oath, stoked a violent mob of domestic terrorists and attempted to tear down our democracy.&nbsp; Hawley was soliciting campaign funds while our nation's Capitol was under attack and people were dying.&nbsp; He is a despicable, self-serving, deplorable, insurrectionist.\n2) As reported in the KC Star, Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley became the first senator to say he\u2019ll object to the certification of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to accept the results of the presidential election.\nHawley cited unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and accused the state of Pennsylvania of failing to adhere to its election laws by extending the deadline for mail-in ballots, an argument that has repeatedly been rejected by federal courts.&nbsp; He held up the Electoral College Vote Certification process twice with his unfounded conspiracy theories, offering zero evidence to support his claims.\n3) Josh Hawley lied when he tweeted that a \"candle-light vigil for democracy\" at his home in Virginia as \"Antifa scumbags came to our place in DC and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can\u2019t travel. They screamed threats, vandalized, and tried to pound open our door.\"&nbsp; Video evidence shows that nothing of the sort happened.&nbsp; The dozen or so protestors chanted, sang and prayed outside his home, but exhibited no violence, threats or vandalism of any sort.\n4) Sen. Josh Hawley doesn't even live in Missouri.&nbsp; A review of property records shows that the first-term Republican is no longer a Missouri homeowner and that he is registered to vote at his sister\u2019s home in Ozark, MO, while he is in-between homes in the state. He has alternately told the press he is living with his parents in Springfield, MO.\nHawley owns a $1.3 million house in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., where he spends most of his time with his wife, Erin Hawley, and their three children.\n5) Two separate MO audits found that in Hawley's short tenure as Missouri\u2019s attorney general there were many paperwork and management problems that may have cost taxpayers unnecessary amounts of money.\nTaxpayer-paid staff working in former Attorney General Josh Hawley\u2019s office met with his political consultants, perhaps more than a dozen times, in the months before he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2017.\nSeveral instances of travel related abuses noted that Hawley used a state vehicle and a driver for some trips without documenting the purpose of the trip. One cited example was that a driver told the auditor that on Dec. 16, 2017, he drove Sen. Hawley and his wife, Erin, to Kansas City for a Chiefs football game.\n6) Former U.S. Sen. John C. Danforth on Thursday, following the domestic terrorist attacks on the U.S. Capitol building, said to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: \"Supporting Josh&nbsp;and trying so hard to get him elected to the Senate was the worst mistake I ever made in my life. Yesterday was the physical culmination of the long attempt (by Hawley and others) to foment a lack of public confidence in our democratic system. It is very dangerous to America to continue pushing this idea that government doesn\u2019t work and that voting was fraudulent.\"\nJosh Hawley is seditious and self-serving. Hawley has blood on his hands for fomenting rioting at the U.S. Capitol. He is dishonest and is not upholding the oaths and ethics of his elected offices. Sen.

Every year, around 100 million animals suffer and are killed for their fur. The vast majority are kept on intensive fur farms. Animals including fox, mink, raccoon dogs and chinchillas are kept for their entire lives in tiny wire cages, before being killed and skinned for so-called fashion.\nNot only do these battery cage systems cause immense animal suffering, they are also now proven to present a serious public-health risk. The cramped conditions, poor hygiene, stress, injuries and disease, minimal veterinary care, and lack of genetic diversity all mean that fur farms create ideal conditions for viruses to be transmitted, and for viruses to mutate creating new strains.\nHundreds of mink farms in countries including the Netherlands, USA, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, Greece, Spain and Lithuania have been found to have animals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. On farms in Denmark, the virus has already mutated into new strains, which have in turn infected people. Disease prevention experts have expressed grave concerns, including the European Centre for Disease Control who stated in a November report that the evolution of the virus in mink could undermine the effectiveness of future vaccines in humans. The report also found that \u201ccontinued transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms may eventually give rise to other variants of concern\u201d.\nGovernments cannot respond to this crisis simply by culling millions of animals and then allowing farmers to return to business as usual. The appalling conditions on fur farms make them a ticking time bomb for pandemic disease risk. Disease transmission experts warn that it is a matter of when, and not if, another deadly virus hits if we continue to keep animals in conditions that push them beyond the limits of their physical and psychological endurance.\nTwenty countries have already acted to ban the farming of animals for their fur because it is cruel, outdated and unnecessary. In light of new evidence that fur farms can also act as reservoirs for deadly viruses, as well as create new viruses, we call on all countries to&nbsp;ban fur farms, and we call on G20 leaders to&nbsp;publicly acknowledge that fur farming must end.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/kl/ht/APklHTkmTGrswSA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607111611"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/it-s-time-to-let-kobe-begin-his-life?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Let's Let Kobe Begin His Life", "description": "By a stroke of fate, I met Kobe from an online correspondence program with people who are currently incarcerated. I was really curious how people in prison were feeling during this time in our world. I am currently a junior studying social work, and I was really interested in learning more about criminal justice and the prison system in our country. I sent out a letter introducing myself, and hoped he would write me back. He wrote back immediately, sharing all about his past with an open heart and honest words. We started writing to each other every week, and soon for me it became less about the prison system and more about the cycle of vulnerability people of color experience in our society. His parents weren't exactly always providing support, unfortunately they had struggles of their own- the system had failed them too. He shared with me that when he was thirteen, he was passed around to his uncle because his mom could not take care of him. He had bounced around the foster system, but eventually his uncle offered to have him come stay. He was taught how to sell drugs and make money quickly. He was thirteen. My little brother is fifteen, and I could never imagine him transferring from one temporary family to the next, and then getting a lesson from the main male figure in his life how to make a living, illegally.&nbsp;\nI believe that Kobe\u2019s bunk bed in prison had his name on it since the day he was born. I believe that the systems we have in place in our society failed him by a large margin. His situation made it clear to me just how privileged I am as a white person in our country. Kobe and I talk every day for an hour. It costs me about $12-$20 per day, but talking to him is like feeling a ray of sunshine after months of clouds. Seeing his face on the tiny grainy video screen is like getting a glimpse into the bright and shiny soul that is within him. Today on our video visit, he closed his eyes and took some deep breaths. He said he was trying hard to have faith, trying to keep his strength, but he wasn\u2019t sure why \u201cthey needed to put me in here for so long.\u201d If prison is supposed to be about rehabilitation, I need to know why this man\u2019s life was taken away from ages 21 to 36. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me how somebody with so much love, care, and incredible ideas is stuck behind a fence where they have to pay outrageous prices for phone calls, work full time to be making less than $1 an hour, isn\u2019t eligible for any financial aid, and sleeps in a room with 100 other men.&nbsp;\nKobe dreams of owning a food truck. He wants it to be southern food and he already has the whole thing drawn out and the menu decided. He wants to get his business degree so he can have an advantage when he\u2019s out, as well as expand his knowledge of how to be a successful business owner. Kobe is an amazing artist. He draws this amazing detailed art on the outside of the envelopes he sends me, and recently I had the idea to turn these drawings into stickers to pay for his degree. It blew up and within 3 weeks he made enough to pay for his degree, which was full priced, because prisoners aren\u2019t eligible for any sort of financial assistance.\nHis smile could make anyone smile.\nHis smile deserves to be seen.\nHis smile and his light and his laughter and his joy deserves to be where people can hear him and see him.\nThe color of his skin gave him an unfair disadvantage in this lifetime, and the least I can do is get his story heard.\nI have people from all different countries wanting to sign a petition to set Kobe free and get his life started. I don\u2019t want him to have to wait 12 more years to start a food truck. I don\u2019t want him to have to wait 12 more years to see his mom. I don\u2019t want him to have to give away his books because he doesn\u2019t have room under his bunk bed. He gave me his all-inclusive book wishlist the other day. It included titles like, \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d \u201cHistory of African Americans,\u201d \u201cAwaken Your Third Eye,\u201d \"The Science of Everyday Life,\" \u201cHow to Start and Run a Food Truck,\u201d \u201cRumi\u2019s Little Book of Love,\u201d and countless other books that just prove how committed Kobe is to changing his life. He is committed to finding the way and the resources to becoming the best person he can be. He realized that he has options that he didn\u2019t realize he had before. He was taught the only way to make money was by doing so the wrong way. He didn\u2019t realize people would buy his art. He was never told that he was worthy or valid. He was never told that he could do anything he wanted. Nobody ever made that clear, in fact society did just the opposite. His closest circle taught him that he was unworthy: unworthy of success, unworthy of love, unworthy of happiness. He had that drummed into him since he was born, and then was expected to rise up despite the entire world relentlessly pushing him down. 12 more years trapped in prison is not the way for him to get started in his life. He is 23 years old. He is just getting his life started. He now knows what he is capable of.&nbsp;\nHow can I show our state he will contribute more to society than the majority of the American population? He plans on becoming a motivational speaker. He plans on opening a nonprofit resource center for single mothers. He has so many things he wants to do, he draws up plans for them all day long.\nAre we going to make him wait another 12 years to get started? Or will we believe in him now? I am respectfully requesting we make this man\u2019s dreams come alive by granting him clemency. He knows now that there are limitless other paths for him, and he is beyond excited to start living his life and break the relentless cycle of vulnerability.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/yn/ej/TdYnejVNCfNdtFO-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610082768"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/us-congress-remove-josh-hawley-from-office-0919156c-29d8-4fde-b793-71275efbfffc?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "They are coming for me!", "description": "Thank you to all those who have signed this petition.

He created Birdsprings Solar company, training local Navajo to create these panels, bidding on government contracts and installing them at places like Chinle Indian Health Services Hospital.&nbsp;\nWe are grateful that a new school expands the history of this great legacy into the future, but we would like to see the original buildings remain as a testament to the original plight of native children being sent to government boarding schools.

We would like to create an amazing interpretive exhibit, showing the history of Birdsprings, of government forces removal of school aged children to residential schools. The legacy of our people, the dreams of Little Singer to bring the children home, and how Little Singer found a quirky white guy that devoted his entire life to bring these children home needs to be saved for future generations.\nIn the future we will be asking for funds to actually create or move this amazing historical opportunity.&nbsp; But for now, we must just stop the irreversible destruction of an amazing future archeological historical site.\nPlease help my family and me to stop the destruction.&nbsp; We can deal with the rebuilding later.&nbsp; Thank you for listening.&nbsp; Please take care.

Whilst in police custody, Zara was asked about the work of her organisation and why she left Islam.\nZara was bailed on 29 December 2020 and told to return to the police station on 31 December.

Trump Park.&nbsp; Public record will show that Trump and his associated development company paid $2 million for this property. After being unable to develop the property, the land was donated to the State of New York which he and his firm used as a tax write-off.&nbsp; This was not a charitable gift derived out of generosity but an equitable exchange of real property for a financial incentive.\nSeveral previous proposed names have all been admirable choices but perhaps have not met the benchmark through which most public lands have been rededicated in our State, to honor individuals rather than perhaps individuals who have donated land. The naming of a park should be that of a historic New Yorker who has made an outstanding contribution to the history and development of our state and one who evokes the values of patriotism, inclusiveness and equity under the law.&nbsp; There are few individuals who embodied the spirit and diversity of New York like Sojourner Truth. It seems only fitting that a park stripped of the name of a man who incited insurrection should be replaced with that of a woman who fought against and helped defeat insurrectionists.&nbsp;\nSojourner Truth was born into slavery as Isabella Baumfree near Kingston, NY in 1797.&nbsp; She was sold at least twice during her early life and was not freed until mandated under State Law in 1827.&nbsp; Truth successfully sued for the return and freedom of her son from the State of Alabama in 1828.&nbsp; As a free person she became active both within her church as well as the abolition and suffrage movements.&nbsp; She gained national notoriety for her speech \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d and would actively participate in the causes of emancipation, enfranchisement and equal protection under the law.&nbsp; Her ardent activism to help her neighbors and fellow Americans was tirelessly carried out all the while supporting and raising a family on her own.&nbsp; Truth passed away at Battle Creek, Michigan in 1883.&nbsp; Shortly after her death Frederick Douglass said she was \u201cVenerable for age, distinguished for insight into human nature, remarkable for independence and courageous self-assertion, devoted to the welfare of her race, she has been for the last forty years an object of respect and admiration to social reformers everywhere.\"", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/eu/fv/EbeufVXNUSCzioD-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610420884"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/utah-state-senate-make-transporting-dogs-unsecured-on-truck-beds-illegal-in-the-state-of-utah?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Make transporting dogs unsecured on truck beds illegal in the state of Utah", "description": "On the afternoon of July 16th myself, husband, and 4 year old daughter were driving north on 1-15 in Ogden, Utah when we witnessed my greatest fear, a dog falling from the bed of a pick up truck going roughly 80 MPH.

Though seventeen states and the District of Columbia have banned pound seizure, Kentucky still allows municipalities and individual shelters to decide whether or not they will release animals to labs.&nbsp;\nAside from subjecting animals to unspeakably inhumane conditions, the practice of pound seizure challenges the integrity of shelters and loses the trust of those surrendering animals. Rather than risk their pet being surrendered to a research facility, many people abandon their pets, leading those animals to face starvation and other threats to their survival.&nbsp;\nIn addition to promoting increased rates of animal abandonment, pound seizure decreases shelters' commitment to securing adoptions for the animals in their care. With a market already available for their animals, shelters are less likely to seek out adopters, especially when an animal meets the specific requirements for a particular lab or institution.\nIn order to abolish pound seizure in the state of Kentucky, the practice must be outlawed and not left to the discretion of municipalities.

The entire coastal plain is critical for the caribou to raise their young, and caribou mothers are particularly sensitive to disruptions in their habitats. The Gwich'in people have a deep cultural and spiritual connection with the caribou, and depend on the Porcupine Caribou herd for about 80% of their diet. Without any habitat for the caribou their way of life will be threatened. Continuing with the plan to drill on the coastline would ultimately threaten the lives of the Gwich'in people, who have lived and depended on the coastal plain for generations. Human lives are not worth sacrificing for corporate greed.&nbsp;\nAside from the clear violations of human rights, destroying the Alaskan environment for oil would also be extremely harmful for polar bears.

However, they told her they could not do anything to help unless Jacob committed a crime.&nbsp;\nJacob\u2019s roommate called every day, for five days with no assistance. On the sixth day, the police were called with allegations of domestic abuse (or it could have been a disturbance) - his roommate did so because remember, they would not come unless Jacob committed a crime. The real reason they were called was for the same reason they were called every day for a week - a mental health crisis. They knew this, the dispatchers told them this.&nbsp;\nWhen they arrived Jacob was in his car outside his complex, suffering from a mental health crisis alone. The police approached Jacob\u2019s vehicle and tried to detain him. Jacob did not want to be detained - remember, he is in the midst of a mental health crisis. A struggle for detainment between the police and Jacob ensued, which ended in a police officer shooting Jacob 10+ times, unloading a full clip, killing him. He was only 26 years old, with so much life ahead of him. Police officers have tasers, batons, rubber bullets and mace. What on earth would constitute using a gun in this situation? Jacob loved and cared for everyone, and tried his best to help others even when he himself was struggling so deeply on the inside.&nbsp;\nThe police reports say he was in possession of a \u201cknife.\u201d But this knife was a pocket knife with a 1.5 inch blade that he would carry on his keychain. This small pocket knife was by law not a deadly weapon, and in no way shape or form did Jacob pose a threat.\nAfter news of his murder spread, protests and riots ensued within Tigard, Oregon, with hundreds protesting such a gross injustice. The news of Jacob\u2019s murder has been localized, but we are here to spread and disseminate it.\nA mental health crisis cannot equal a death sentence. Police departments and their forced MUST be retrained and there must be protocols in place to assist those who are obviously in need of mental health assistance. Many countries and states such as Colorado have a mental health force that arrives at a mental crisis scene prior to law enforcement, to de-escalate the situation as opposed to what the police did to Jacob. This needs to be instated in every state and county.\nWe are not asking for condolences or prayers, we are asking for help - help in getting justice for Jacob in a system that whole heartedly protects the police. If you have any extra funds, please consider donating to his twin sister\u2019s go fund me: https://www.gofundme.com/f/28xlfpc0hc You can also sign this petition to help get justice for Jacob, or spread his story if you get the chance. If you have some extra time and feel like being an activist, you could email or call Tigard, Oregon officials regarding Jacob.\nOur system needs change, and people need to be held accountable, no matter the occupational title they hold.&nbsp;\nWe are trying to reach the attention of Oregon governor Kate Brown to ensure that justice be brought upon Jacob by having the officer(s) who are responsible for his murder fired and charges immediately filed.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ea/cv/AmeAcVlFdzzcgED-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610322846"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/removepaulgosar-protect-our-constitution?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "#RemovePaulGosar - Protect our Constitution.", "description": "#RemovePaulGosar from Congress.

The one guard present that day never stepped out of her booth. I was notified of my son\u2019s murder and the circumstances surrounding his death approximately six hours after the incident, not by any prison official, but by another inmate. The officials of the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) have yet to speak with me concerning what happened to my son. Not only have they refused to speak with me, but the officials at Macon State Prison failed to secure and return Carrington\u2019s personal belongings to me, and have denied having any records on him. Carrington had been incarcerated since he was seventeen years old as a first offender on aggravated assault charges. At the time of his murder, he was just months shy of his 24 birthday, and his release from prison.\nStarting with the day my son was murdered, &nbsp;I have been lied to and given the run-around, and pretty much ignored by Warden Perry, the Facilities Director; Scott Crickmar, and the GDC. I even attempted to relay my concerns to Commissioner Timothy Ward, whose disposition was rude, defensive, and insensitive. Commissioner Ward refused to have a conversation with me and ended the call abruptly. I must admit, his response was disheartening; as I am a grieving mother whose son lost his life in one of Commissioner Ward\u2019s Prisons. As one of the \u201cGatekeepers\u201d of the GDC, I would think a conversation with a bereaved mother would be the least he could have done. I've also emailed Commissioner Ward inquiring about changes that are being implemented to help ensure the safety of other inmates; I have yet to hear from him. I\u2019ve written to the office of Governor Brian Kemp, twice, not only concerning the murder of my son, but also the rampant violence and deplorable conditions of Macon State Prison. Just like his subordinates, Governor Kemp has failed to acknowledge me and my concerns, my son's murder, and the unconstitutional conditions of Macon State Prison. I have tirelessly poured out my heart in correspondence to the U.S Department of Justice pleading for a full investigation into Macon State Prison. Again, it appears I\u2019ve fallen on deaf ears. Is there a leader anywhere who cares about this life and death issue that affects the lives of the people who\u2019ve helped put them in positions of political power?! This is not an \u201cincarcerated folks\u201d problem. This is a societal problem. What happened to Carrington is not an isolated incident, but a systemic issue of inhumane conditions, corruption, injury and death. The critical staffing shortage, improperly trained staff, lack of appropriate security and surveillance, obscured and improperly working security cameras, corruption and breakdown in communication processes have placed the Georgia Department of Corrections in a crisis. There have been far too many murders at Macon State Prison alone. Our loved ones are not coming home. And those who do are often worse off; inflicted with mental illnesses; PTSD, depression, sleep deprivation, and paranoia; from things they\u2019ve witnessed and experienced behind those prison walls. Many of these same offenders are released back into society in a continuous cycle of untreated mental illness, frequent ER visits with unpaid, and piling healthcare debt, reactive criminal thinking and recidivism.\nOur Gatekeepers need to be held accountable to the obligations of their position, and their duty to uphold the Constitution for ALL. We cannot afford for our leaders to continue to ignore this grave issue. My son, and many others have paid with their blood. Please help me in this urgent call to action for the U.S Department of Justice to launch a full investigation into the deplorable conditions of Macon State Prison, and the GDC as a whole; In hopes that what happened to Carrington will not happen to another prisoner.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/xm/xs/dAXmxsyXKKdNVzR-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609785074"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/easy-day-studios-gameplay-improvements-for-skater-xl?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Gameplay Improvements for Skater XL", "description": "SkaterXL is a skateboarding simulation, and yet it does not provide a true simulation of actual skateboarding. Skateboarding is individualistic, rooted in creativity, and a totally unique experience depending on who is on the board/behind the controller. This game as a whole would appeal to a much broader demographic (including real world skateboarders) if everyone&nbsp;had the option to control their \"stats\" like we do via mods on PC.\nA majority of the improvements on PC are simple code edits that would be trivial to add on console (including SoundMod, which, for the most part, is simply replacing a bunch of audio files), and would greatly improve the overall gameplay experience for EVERYONE, both on PC and console. Easy Day Studios, please consider adding these improvements to the base game, as they will do nothing but increase the playability, longevity, and overall enjoyment of the wonderful game that you have created. The community as a WHOLE is begging you to give us what have been staples of the PC experience to everyone, so that we can all enjoy this game to its fullest potential. PLEASE.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nMain wishes:\n\nCustomizable \"stats\" (pop height, gravity, push force, etc).\nSoundMod.\nDeck customization (width, truck size, wheel size, etc).\nPost processing options, such as XLGraphics/Babbo Settings (which literally utilize the built-in post-processing effects within the Unity Engine) would be fantastic as well.&nbsp;\n\nWe as a community believe these improvements are integral to the success of this game, and that the lack of such options is doing nothing but pushing potential (as well as current) players away.

Chesa Must Resign. Our beloved city has seen an astronomical increase in crime, even under Covid-19 restrictions. In 2020, violent crime, home invasions, rampant and unchecked drug dealing and business property theft have turned our city upside down. We citizens are sick and tired of it. Demand SFDA Chesa Boudin resign immediately.\nEvery resident and every visitor to San Francisco is a potential target. Our homes, our property and our lives are at risk.\nMr. Boudin has been in office barely a year, and in his disastrous social experiment of criminal justice \"reform\" and the so-called restorative justice model, he has instead dismantled the criminal justice system. This was not by accident- Mr. Boudin has actually planned to allow mayhem on San Francisco's streets and in our homes. He schemes to vastly favor criminals over law-abiding citizens.\nWe will involve SF Mayor London Breed\nMayor London Breed has been conspicuously quiet on this issue- and has not come forth with outrage. The city must hear from her and we will demand she condemns Chesa Boudin. We therefore implore Mayor Breed to use her voice and her podium at City Hall to join us in demanding Mr. Boudin resign.\nDismal Crime Statistics\nCrime statistics for the year ending December 2020: Burglaries are up 47% , Car thefts are up 34% , Arson 39% and Homicides over 10% . Drug overdose deaths surpassed 620 in 2020 due in part to Mr Boudin's hands-off-drug-dealers approach. Car break-ins are now so prevalent, car owners have simply stopped reporting them.\nA District Attorney is supposed to prosecute criminals\nCriminal justice, and the prosecution of crimes, is the responsibility of the District Attorney's office. Mr Boudin, as the city's chief law enforcement officer and head prosecutor, has actually declined to take on cases, thereby sending a signal to criminals than they may run free throughout San Francisco without consequence. What's more outrageous is that he cannot be fired, as he was elected.\nSF Crime Dashboard\nWe have witnessed outrageous incidents during 2020, where Mr Boudin failed to act. Every incident appears increasingly heinous, and just this New Years Eve, a paroled criminal fleeing in a stolen car hit and killed 2 pedestrians in downtown San Francisco.

The historically ceremonial process was stopped as lawmakers were forced into hiding. There were multiple deaths and injuries.\nThis was an unprecedented assault and nothing short of an attempted coup.

He has shown a flagrant disregard for the rules and our democracy. Hundreds of political scientists have signed an open letter that calls for Trump's removal from office.&nbsp;We must stop our country from backsliding into authoritarianism.

During the 2020 season, the Texans achieved a mediocre 4-12 record. While there are many people to blame for this sad state of affairs, the two main culprits are clear: Bill O'Brien and Jack Easterby. While many of you are likely familiar with the former GM and Head Coach of the Texans, Bill O'Brien, there is a lesser known figure by the name of Jack Easterby, the Executive VP of football operations, who may shoulder more of the blame for the current state of the Texans even more than O'Brien.&nbsp;\nJack Easterby is by all accounts a good man who has helped lead and inspire many young athletes over their careers. However, being a good Christian does not qualify you to have a large influence over personnel decisions, nor does it qualify you to establish a team culture. These are both things that Easterby has undertaken during his tenure with the Texans. A former chaplain for the New England Patriots,&nbsp; Easterby has somehow risen through the ranks of the Texans organization and is now considered by many to be the right hand man of Owner, Cal Mcnair. I highly reccomend reading this article by sports illustrated to gain a deeper understanding of exactly how Jack Easterby is leading the Texans down a path that will not only lead to being a mediocre football team, but alienating multiple members of the staff and more importantly, the players.&nbsp;\nOn the other side of the coin is Deshaun Watson. I can't really say more about Deshaun other than he's one of the best players in football today. He signed a massive contract extension in the offseason, and deservedly so. With a ragtag receiving corps for much of the year, Watson led the NFL in passing this season. Aside from that, Deshaun is a great humanitarian and has been since entering the League in 2017. He is a generational talent, and beyond that he's a generational player, similar to JJ Watt in his ability to not only impact a football game but the community at large. He is too important of a person to squander years of his professional career like this past year, and I fear that will continue to happen if Easterby remains.\nIt has become increasingly more clear in recent days that Deshaun is not happy with the leadership in the Texans front office, saying on Sunday, \"We need a whole culture shift. We need new energy. We need discipline, we need structure, we need a leader. We've got to have love for people and people in this organization.\"&nbsp;\nJack Easterby is the man who created the current culture on Kirby Drive in Houston.\nWhat was the Texans' response to their young star publicly clamoring for a shift in culture, a fresh start? They went out and hired Nick Caserio, director of player personnel for the New England Patriots, and by all accounts one of Jack Easterby's best friends.\nMore. of. the. same.\nIt's too early to judge Caserio, and in a vacuum it seems like a strong hire. He was part of multiple Super Bowl winning teams in New England and is credited as being a man obsessed with establishing a winning culture and creating a championship caliber team. But, his first move as GM needs to be to fire Jack Easterby. Easterby has overstayed his welcome in Houston, and while it doesn't sit well with me to campaign for another man to lose his job in the middle of a pandemic, I don't care. There is too much at stake to keep this man as part of the Texans.\nReports have come out in the league this morning that Deshaun has discussed the possibility of a trade out of Houston, something that the Texans franchise could likely never recover from.\nSo please, sign my petition and help rescue Deshaun Watson. The Texans already squandered the hall of fame careers of Andre Johnson, JJ Watt, and traded away Deandre Hopkins (in large part due to Easterby). If you care about the NFL and Deshaun Watson as an athlete and a person then help me get rid of Jack Easterby and get Deshaun the fresh start he needs. Don't do it for the Texans. Do it for Deshaun.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/mh/sw/eGmhSWDxJqBpRbQ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610043525"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/department-of-justice-stop-the-execution-of-dustin-higgs?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop the execution of Dustin Higgs!", "description": "Dustin Higgs was convicted and sentenced to the death penalty for being the accomplice to the 1996 murder of three young women.\nThe problem here is Hayes, the one who committed the ACTUAL crime was NOT sentenced to the death penalty, he was given 45 years +life by a separate jury, even though he committed the crime.

Since then, Snowbowl has made numerous modifications to its operations, some without any environmental review, public involvement, or Tribal consultation. Aerial photographs reveal Snowbowl's construction of a new parking lot in an area known as Hart Prairie, which will rapidly expand its business to a year-round model.&nbsp; In 2005, the Coconino National Forest refused to even discuss allowing an increase in daily visitation above 2,825 skiers per day, insisting that they would keep parking capacity static to prevent an increase in visitors.\nNow, a new lot is being constructed for skier use, which, along with operation of a free shuttle system, the USFS admits \u201cdecouples the previous tie between parking and visitation.\u201d&nbsp; It is is also causing severe environmental degradation and erosion of a formerly intact meadow ecosystem.&nbsp; The lot is&nbsp;being constructed without required public notice, comment and review procedures, and without Indigenous consultation.&nbsp; According to research by Sierra Club - Grand Canyon Chapter, this is just one example of several ways that the United States Forest Service is allowing violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Endangered Species Act.&nbsp; Snowbowl\u2019s desire for profit is threatening biodiversity, groundwater safety, and human communities that have been developing here for millennia.\nMost of the Indigenous Nations who revere this mountain are in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District.&nbsp; These Indigenous votes contributed to Congressman Tom O\u2019Halleran\u2019s and Senator Mark Kelly\u2019s elections in 2020.&nbsp; ICF is calling for an investigation and field hearing led by Representative O\u2019Halleran, to publicly disclose how the USFS is enabling Arizona Snowbowl\u2019s violations.&nbsp; We are calling on Rep. O\u2019Halleran to direct the Forest Service to end Snowbowl\u2019s impunity.&nbsp; The Forest Service must conduct a thorough review of cultural and environmental impacts, including required public involvement, of all modifications made at the resort since 2005, and Snowbowl must be held responsible for remediation of all environmental impacts before further business continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call for public notice and a process of public review, comment, and legitimate Indigenous consultation before Arizona Snowbowl\u2019s forthcoming Master Development Plan is reviewed by the Coconino National Forest Supervisor Laura Jo West.

Meeting the GPA requirement now hinges solely on two semesters of grades, one of them being this fall\u2019s grades during the pandemic and increased civil unrest in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;I reached out to my school for academic support early in the semester. I was given two options: withdraw without financial reimbursement (during a pandemic/economic crisis) or excel in my finals. As my school does not currently have an appeal process, this situation placed the responsibility of success entirely on me.&nbsp;\nWhile I recognize the importance of success in law school and its direct correlation to future success on the bar, I believe my school could have provided more support, options or at least the opportunity to appeal given the circumstances we are currently living under.&nbsp;In addition to the aforementioned challenges, I am currently facing housing insecurity. When I met with one of my school\u2019s deans and the Director of Students no resources were offered. The Dean of Students scoffed and laughed at my request for support, even as I described my housing insecurity.&nbsp;\nThe pandemic, and civil unrest in D.C. have made the past few months extremely challenging. Some of these extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, being stabbed by a Proud Boy, being unlawfully arrested, being subjected to slander by a national news outlet, facing housing insecurity, and receiving death threats from far-right militants.&nbsp;My law school has not made any effort to support students financially (except those with exceptional GPAs, which is unfortunately not a plausible reality for everyone right now). I have prioritized paying for my education over housing, and to now be dealing with expulsion is devastating.&nbsp;\nThis letter, with additional support from the community, will show my school that others agree the administration\u2019s actions in the face of a global pandemic and civil unrest have been preposterous.

In December, the BOE decided to&nbsp; re-evaluate the decision to return to all virtual teaching (except for some small group in-person classes) based on State BOE guidelines as follows:&nbsp; at or below 5/100,000 positive cases per week and less than 5% positivity rate in our county (at&nbsp; or above 15/100,000 cases the guideline states limited or no in-person programs). We have not met these metrics and cases are increasing. As of 1/06/21, Carroll County's positivity rate is 8.2% and as of 1/10/2021 it has 46/100,000 positive cases. Mr. Hoover described how the hospital is being strained and some surgeries must be cancelled. Science is being ignored. The more we gather in any setting, including schools, we give the virus legs to travel and spread in the community. Let's not put into harm's way the progress that has been made to have small groups of students gather for learning (special education, English language learners and Career and Tech).&nbsp;\nThe health and safety of faculty, staff and students is not of primary concern to the BOE. Despite testimony from teachers and the CCEA Union representative describing health and safety concerns, the BOE voted to resume hybrid teaching. One staff person at a middle school has passed away from COVID-19.&nbsp;\nThe main reason cited by the BOE to return to hybrid learning was the rise in students' failing grades. However, they didn't survey the community to see who would return to in-person learning and if, in fact, it is students who received failing grades in the first quarter. 660 less students are participating in hybrid learning this time than participated in October. At West Middle School only 39% of the student body returned for hybrid learning and 15 classrooms have substitute teachers supervising students. It is not an idea that is gaining traction among parents yet the BOE continues to put faculty, staff and students health and safety at risk. Hybrid learning by its nature divides a teacher's attention between the few students in the classroom and those who are online. How does this effectively address the need of students who are failing?&nbsp;\nFinally, teacher and staff morale is plummeting as the BOE demonstrates meeting after meeting that their well-being is of no concern. Our children are losing experienced educators to early retirement and long-term medical leave. BOE's short-sightedness will cause our children to have years of educational loss and lag by losing many educators to other school districts that will value their talents and humanity.\nThe BOE must reverse its January 4, 2021 decision and return to virtual learning until the State Board of Education metrics are met.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/jb/qz/UMJBQzICmjcQGVt-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610371652"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/department-of-homeland-security-stop-ice-from-deporting-women-who-are-victims-to-coerced-hysterectomies?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop ICE from Deporting Women Who are Victims to Coerced Hysterectomies!", "description": "On September 14, Dawn Wooten, an&nbsp;ex-nurse&nbsp;at the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia, filed a whistleblower complaint to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General\u2019s office, outlining concerns over medical neglect at the facility. One of the most shocking sections of the complaint, outlined concern of unwarranted hysterectomies being performed on women at the facility. The&nbsp;27-page&nbsp;complaint excluded specific names of the victims or the gynecologist in question, but after the report gained attention, brave women at these centers came forward and shared their stories. Their stories exposed Dr. Mahendra Amin\u2019s invasive procedures and unwarranted hysterectomies being performed on these women. An investigation later done by the New York Times revealed that these medical procedures were unnecessary and could have been avoided with much less invasive treatments. Furthermore, women revealed that not only were invasive procedures common, but many times, there was no&nbsp;interpreter&nbsp;present to help the women understand what procedures they were consenting to when signing consent forms.&nbsp;In response to the allegations, public support was joined with the support of lawmakers, who demanded that the Department of Homeland Security inspector general\u2019s office investigate the validity of the claims.&nbsp;\nToday, there is an ongoing investigation into the allegations by the FBI,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Justice Department, and the DHS inspector general\u2019s office, however, the women who have bravely come forward, are now being deported.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks ago, six women who alleged abuse from the doctor were deported. The remaining women who courageously came forward, are now facing the same imminent threat.&nbsp;\nWe must demand that no more women be deported during the ongoing investigation into the allegations. These women are vital witnesses and evidence to the investigation, and we cannot allow ICE or Dr. Mahendra Amin to get away with their actions. Excluding them from the investigation means the continuation of an improper and unjust investigation. These women have already experienced inhumane and life changing treatment and we must stand with them and demand that their human rights be protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/qn/gc/SNQngCguwHtEPbZ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607636633"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/justin-price-ri-rep-justin-price-resign?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "RI Rep. Justin Price: RESIGN!", "description": "On January 6th, domestic terrorists stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States.\nYesterday, Rhode Island Representative Justin Price (Exeter, Richmond, Hopkinton) admitted on Twitter that he was at the Capitol with the violent mob when the building was stormed. After people started noticing what he said, Rep. Price was quick to say that he did not technically go *inside* the Capitol building, but he has REFUSED to answer whether or not he crossed police lines and how close he got to the Capitol building. He has since DEFENDED the domestic terrorists who went inside the capitol and blamed the attack on left-wing infiltrators, a completely disproven attempt by people like Rep. Price to deflect from his role in instigating this violent insurrection and attack on our country.\nNot only was Rep. Price AT the attack on the US Capitol, but his anti-American actions and promotion of far-right conspiracy theories DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED to the attack on the Capitol.\nRep. Price is a traitor to our state and to our country. He has broken the oath he took to protect and serve the Constitution and is an active threat to our democracy! Rep. Price must resign immediately and cannot be allowed to represent us in the RI House of Representatives.", "image_url":

Jefferson County should not rename a part of a highway to appease a tyrannical president. Jefferson County is a growing community of scholars, hard workers, and we are increasing in the numbers of people of color moving to JeffCo and I believe that renaming such a busy stretch of the highway will only deter those who could help us keep growing.\nThere are a plethora of reasons to not rename this highway in honor of DJT but here are some to jog your memory; 1) lying to us about the dangers of COVID-19; 2) His over 25 sexual misconduct and abuse allegations; 3) his racial prejudice; 4) collusion with Russia in 2016 election; 5) losing the popular vote, TWICE; 6) he was impeached and could potentially become impeached again; And lastly, President Trump incited riots at our nation's capital- where 5 people died- in order to protest the fair and free Presidential election outcome. And at the riots, dressed from head to toe in Trump gear were White Supremacists, Nazis, and members of the KKK.\nI fear that if we rename a portion of that highway to DJT then the monsters hidden among us will feel more comfortable and Jefferson County might become a place where it is no longer safe for women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color.\nPlease consider signing this petition.

At the time Nick was just a 15-year old highschool freshman with his whole life ahead of him. That night, Nick was arrested for a local robbery. Availing himself of his right to a trial by jury, Nick believed that the court would take it easy on him. That decision would prove fateful.\nDespite his tender age, Nick was tried and sentenced as an adult to a total of 68-years with a Mandatory Minimum 33-year term for his involvement in a crime where he physically hurt no one. A consecutive mandatory sentence that the trial court erroneously believed that it was required to apply, by law.\nIn 2012, for the first time, in a separate case (Brown v. Commonwealth), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that a trial court was not required to run multiple sentences for use of a firearm consecutively with each other, effectively eliminating its application as a mandatory minimum. This ruling should have invalidated Nick's sentence. Unfortunately, the holding in Brown came several years too late for Nick's sentencing and washed away any hope in a second chance that he held.\nIn America, there has been much discussion concerning the harshness and legitimacy of mandatory minimum sentencing, especially concerning our juvenile offenders. Here we had a young, charismatic and promising African American teenager who in one fleeting instance made the biggest mistake of his life and was condemned to spend a large portion of his adult life behind bars without a chance of parole. Instead of offering him an opportunity to turn his life around and to become a contributing member of our society, he was shown that his life did not matter. As it stands, Nick would be nearly 50-years old when released. The harsh sentence was unwarranted and Nick deserves a second chance!\nDespite his too-harsh sentencing, Nick decided to do his best to better himself and has matured into a solid citizen in prison. Nick has renounced his juvenile criminal past and has demonstrated extreme remorse for his part in the robbery and has redeemed himself. Recognizing that education is the key to personal development, Nick has a very long list of academic and personal achievements earned while incarcerated, including successfully completing a series of classes and programs from Washington &amp; Lee University. Nick's professor from W&amp;L, Howard Pickett, an Associate Professor of Ethics and Poverty, has recognized Nick's talents and complete rehabilitation and is asking for Nick to get a second chance. Professor Pickett in a letter to the Governor of Virginia states that Nick \"is one of the most thoughtful and uncommonly introspective students I have taught in more than a decade of teaching at both the University of Virginia and W&amp;L\".\nWe, as a community, believe that Nick deserves a second chance at life. We believe that he should rejoin us as a contributing member of our society. If you too believe that Nick deserves a second chance, please sign our petition asking Virginia Governor Ralph S. Northam to show mercy and grant Nick clemency.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/uh/yp/ESUHYPBptGbcfKU-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608686200"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/tik-tok-stop-unnecessary-censorship-of-sex-workers-on-tik-tok?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop Unnecessary Censorship of Sex Workers On Tik Tok", "description": "Tik Tok is a lip synch platform that has been growing in popularity; for many groups of people it has helped foster community and speak out about inequalities and discrimination they experience. Sex workers are no different in that sense; we have grown a community of our own. We seek to educate the public on our job and the realities of what we experience; how we navigate the world in an industry that is frowned upon and often times disregarded by society.\nRecently, sex workers have come under fire by social media platforms. Instagram started in November of 2020, and now Tik Tok is following in their footsteps. In the new Tik Tok terms of service, which will be integrated on December 20th, 2020, it has specifically targeted sex workers in their promotion of their other platforms in order to generate income using the followings they have gained through Tik Tok.\nThe new guidelines state that Tik Tok creators can not, \"upload, stream or share content that depicts, promotes, or glorifies sexual solicitation, including offering or asking for sexual partners, sexual chats or imagery, sexual services, premium sexual content or sexcamming.\"\nNumerous sex workers have been \"deplatformed\" and have had their accounts deleted; many times also having videos taken down that have no mention their work.\nAs sex workers, we seek to educate the public on the realities of our jobs. We wish to be seen as people, we wish for our job not to dehumanize us in the publics eye, and we wish not to be put down. We wish not to have all the work we've put into growing our platforms thrown away. We wish for our work to be normalized so that stigmatization around sex work can be debunked and we can let the world know what we are; people. People with a job that helps put food on our tables, keep roofs over ours and our families head, and create futures for ourselves.\nOn a platform with so much reach, why are we discarded after our stories are used for entertainment and help the app generate income? Why can a platform benefit off of our work and we can not?&nbsp;\nThere is a common narrative in society of sex workers stories being used to market and make money, while simultaneously blocking us out from the conversation or the revenue it generates. Sex workers are continually ignored, and this brings great harm to us. By leaving us out of these conversations, stigma grows and we are left to try and mend the harm done. We are left at greater risk than before, because we were not allowed to use our voices about our own community.\nSex workers are a valid part of any community and sex work offers work to those who can not maintain the stressors of an everyday nine to five job. Sex workers on Tik Tok have created inclusive spaces, worked to educate those around us, and take care of our community; we want other sex workers to know that they are not alone. We want other sex workers to know that they are valid and that there are other people out there who know what they are going through.&nbsp;\nThe goal of this petition is to remove the guidelines that very specifically target sex workers on Tik Tok. We want to be able to advertise our other platforms without facing backlash or consequence for using the followings we have worked for to generate income for ourselves.&nbsp;\nSex workers are members of your community; we're the people in line behind you at the grocery store, we're the parents dropping our kids off at school, we're your next door neighbor. We're people, and we are people who deserve as much respect and consideration as anyone else.\nPlease stand with us, please use your voice to help us be heard, please use the power you have to help a community who is silenced by those who use us for profit.

Tragically, many people suffering in unhealthy, unsanitary conditions are dying of neglect.&nbsp;\nAct now to save parks and the environment. The human tragedies playing out in our parks are being compounded as beloved parks, green spaces and sensitive waterways are being overrun, deeply damaged, and needlessly sacrificed.

We need to act now to preserve and protect our urban forests, wildlife, and our most environmentally sensitive waterways.&nbsp;\nSeattle is one of the most educated, wealthy, and generous places in the United States. Every year, the residents of the Puget Sound area spend over $1 billion on homelessness. City of Seattle spending has more than quintupled in recent years, to a budget of $167 million for 2021, which makes it all the more difficult for community members to understand how we could have failed to prevent one of the worst homeless crises in the country.\nSolutions are as complex and varied as the reasons that people become homeless in the first place. But the one thing that everyone who is homeless has in common is they lack shelter and many now lack any place to go where they can be supported with the basics of a warm space, hygiene services, and a supportive community.\nIt\u2019s time for a true emergency response to this crisis. We know what to do. Every year communities all across America effectively respond to homelessness caused by floods, fires, and earthquakes. In the same way, we can create and utilize safe bridge shelter options such as hotel rooms, tiny home villages, Pallet shelters, and sanctioned tent communities in thousands of non-parks properties available in King County to quickly provide affordable, voluntary, safe shelter.

After years of struggling with serious mental illness, my 17-year-old son Daniel Weisberger had a psychotic break, attacking me and his brother, Pascal, and is now charged with Pascal\u2019s death. Despite this terrible outcome, Daniel greatly loved both his brother and me, and is utterly heartbroken by Pascal\u2019s loss, wishing every second of each day during the past seven months he has been in jail that his brother were still with us.\nThis tragic reality is the result of Daniel being subjected to years of physical and emotional cruelty, behavior that went on for much of his childhood, as well as a mental health system inadequate to help him overcome the serious psychological issues caused by the abuse. Despite this well-documented history, last January multiple state agencies responsible for Daniel\u2019s welfare made the egregious decision to place him back with his abuser and failed to properly safeguard that he would be treated appropriately this time.\nThe consequence of these actions was Daniel being traumatized by months of emotional and physical abuse and neglect, leading to the precipitous deterioration in his mental well-being, which ultimately triggered the actions alleged to have caused his brother\u2019s death.&nbsp;\nDespite Daniel\u2019s age and the obvious role that child abuse and mental illness played in this tragedy, the Monroe County State Attorney\u2019s office has charged Daniel as an adult and intends for him to spend decades in prison, essentially eliminating his chance for a future. Pascal\u2019s death was a tragedy beyond comprehension, but long-term imprisonment for Daniel will only lead to the lives of both boys being destroyed, when one can still be saved.\nUnfortunately, despite the wishes of our family and I, the legal system has not been pursuing a fair outcome for Daniel. Though a victim in the case, I strongly believe that Daniel being denied a future is unacceptable, and as someone who knew Pascal better than anyone, I am confident he would feel the same. That is why I\u2019m asking for your help to provide Daniel with the best legal assistance possible, to press for a resolution that will acknowledge that he is a mentally ill child in need of long-term mental health treatment, not incarceration.\nThe push for criminal justice reform and an improved mental health system have garnered increasing focus around our country. Improvements in these areas are particularly necessary with juveniles, who differ from adults in many ways, including their level of brain development and ability to make appropriate decisions. Children charged with a crime deserve to be treated in a manner that acknowledges their stage of development and emphasizes treatment and rehabilitation, especially when mental health is a contributing factor.\nEven serious crimes should be handled in light of these factors: A case in point is a noteworthy example years ago in Miami that was successfully resolved and had a number of approaches relevant and appropriate for Daniel. See https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1989-09-10-8903020457-story.html and https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1993-10-03-9309170554-story.html for further information.\nAs a father, I have always loved my boys equally, and while I continue to grieve Pascal\u2019s loss, I strongly believe that Daniel is a good person who should be helped, not incarcerated. Daniel didn\u2019t deserve to suffer the trauma of abuse and mental illness, and the truth is that no one loved Pascal more than Daniel, or is more devastated by the reality of his loss. Daniel should have received better help to overcome the struggles he has faced, but was instead placed in situations that further undermined his emotional and psychological well-being.\nThe past can\u2019t be undone, but Daniel deserves our care and support in the present. We need to ensure this time he gets the help necessary to provide a way through this terrible tragedy, and to the positive life that Pascal would want for him.\nTo support Pascal's way (https://www.facebook.com/PascalsWay.org/ )for Daniel's future, a path to redemption and a meaningful life for his brother, instead of one wasted in prison, please voice this message to the Monroe County State Attorney\u2019s Office by insisting that:\n&nbsp;(1) Daniel, who is 17, be charged as a juvenile, instead of as an adult.\n&nbsp;(2) Daniel\u2019s background with mental illness and as a victim of child abuse be strongly considered in the case against him\n&nbsp;(3) The case be resolved through a focus on mental health treatment and rehabilitation\nIf you care about Daniel's future and would also be willing to help provide him with an effective legal defense please follow this link to contribute:&nbsp;https://gogetfunding.com/support-pascals-way-for-daniels-future/", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ko/nu/vVkOnUHUZssFYkC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609661512"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/supervisor-kathryn-barger-fix-the-la-county-shelters-help-us-maximize-the-lives-saved?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Fix the LA County shelters!

Quinlan responded to Schuyler that this was not the place to bring up his concerns regarding membership. Schuyler then verbally attacked Quinlan, declaring, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have freedom of speech and you\u2019re not going to tell me it\u2019s not the place for me to bring this up.\u201d After Quinlan explained that she was attempting to utilize the position given to her by the Society to present on accessibility and inclusion in virtual conferences, Schuyler aggressively proclaimed, \u201cSieg Heil to you\u201d and raised his hand in the Nazi salute.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u201cSieg Heil, which translates to \u201cHail Victory\u201d was one of the most notorious Nazi slogans used during the Third Reich, and has since been adopted by neo-Nazi groups. The U.S. Constitution protects free speech under the First Amendment. Yet, the right to speak is not unlimited and Schuyler\u2019s words should not be protected by his \u201cright to free speech.\u201d This act was not only speech but also actual behavior because Schuyler raised his hand in a Nazi salute. These words and salute are especially harmful and offensive to Jewish people in general and especially to those whose families were murdered in the Holocaust.&nbsp;Just to illustrate the severity of Schuyler\u2019s use of this expression, it is important to note that use of this slogan is currently punishable in Germany with up to three years in prison. This exemplifies the seriousness with which Germany views the use of this term that is directly associated with the Nazi regime.&nbsp;Notably, Schuyler\u2019s blatantly antisemitic behavior took place on the same day that white nationalist rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. As media reports have shown, some of these rioters also displayed antisemitic symbols. One man wore a black \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d t-shirt, depicting a skull and crossbones and the phrase \u201cwork brings freedom\u201d an English translation of the concentration camp motto \u201cArbeit macht frei.\u201d&nbsp;Another man wore a t-shirt with the inscription 6MWE and yellow symbols originating in Italian Fascism. This acronym is common among far-right white supremacists, and stands for \u201csix million wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d referring to the Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust, and suggesting the wearer\u2019s intent and desire to continue the genocide of Jews.Schuyler has confirmed his actions to the Daily Pennsylvanian. He does not deny his use of the Nazi slogan and salute during the conference, nor does he believe that he deserves to be disciplined. Moreover, as of January 10, Schuyler had not yet presented an apology to Quinlan. &nbsp;As the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors whose family members perished under the Nazi regime, and as a University of Pennsylvania undergraduate student, I find Professor Schuyler\u2019s actions incredibly offensive and absolutely unacceptable. I, along with countless other students and community members who have signed this petition, respectfully call upon the University of Pennsylvania to immediately fire Robert Schuyler. His actions are appalling, impermissible, and utterly disgraceful. Antisemitic and racist behavior does not align with the University\u2019s values, and cannot be tolerated under any circumstance. &nbsp;While Schuyler\u2019s actions have been condemned by both the Penn Museum and Penn\u2019s Anthropology Department Chair, condemnation is not enough. Robert Schuyler must be held accountable for his actions, and should no longer hold the title of a Penn professor nor have any affiliation with Penn. As an institution, Penn must take disciplinary action to demonstrate that intolerable behavior has consequences, and to ensure that this does not happen again. &nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Useful Information:\nLink to Daily Pennsylvanian article: https://www.thedp.com/article/2021/01/nazi-salute-phrase-archaeology-conference-penn-professor-robert-schuyler&nbsp;Link to the Daily Pennsylvanian\u2019s video segment of the incident: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZXPD-ndgvE&amp;feature=emb_title", "image_url": "https://static.change.org/profile-img/default-user-profile.svg"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/u-s-national-park-services-hold-petroglyph-park-ranger-accountable-in-tasing-of-indigenous-praying-man?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Hold Petroglyph Park Ranger Accountable in Tasing of Indigenous Praying Man", "description": "On Sunday, December 27 2020, Darrell House, a Native American and a Marine Veteran, was tased by a Park Ranger while praying a few feet off trail at Petroglyph National Monument.

This concurrently shut down any and all pages managed personally or professionally handled by said administrators. We believe that the disabling of their accounts was either done in error or that they have been wrongfully reported. The entire purpose of their page, their organization, and their work as a non-profit and as educational leaders is to support and elevate the field of Deaf Education. We, at California Association of the Deaf (CAD), are in full support of their past and present endeavors. Furthermore, we do not see any violation of Facebook misuse and ask you to join us in this public appeal.&nbsp;\nCurrently, when any of the Cal-ED administrators attempts to log in to Facebook, they would be met with the consistent response that their personal account has been disabled as they \u201cdid not follow Community Standards.\u201d If they attempt to appeal this decision or follow procedure requesting that it be reviewed, they have been told this decision \u201ccannot be reversed.\u201d Upon realizing such shocking disciplinary action was taken upon multiple board members, they also realized many of their personal and professional livelihoods were impacted. This action not only impacted Cal-ED and its administrators but any and all organizations they supported or were affiliated with.

This is a dangerous measure that will jeopardize the safety of students and the community. For the week ending January 8th, Blair County was classified in the \"substantial\" transmission level, the highest of three levels. The PA Department of Health recommends that counties in the substantial level adopt a fully remote learning model.\nSocial distancing will not be possible if the entire student body is in school at the same time. This is especially true in the cafeteria, where students will have to take their masks off to eat. There is simply not enough room for everyone to be spread six feet apart. Even during the hybrid model, students were not always six feet apart in classes. It would be impossible for students to be properly distanced in a full in-person model.\nThe lack of social distancing, in addition to putting students and staff at risk, would also cause a drastic increase in the amount of quarantined students. A single student testing positive could easily cause dozens of students to be quarantined. If the school district ends remote instruction, quarantined students will not be able to attend class for two weeks. This would drastically and negatively impact educational outcomes.\nAdditionally, current school policy allows students and teachers to wear face shields instead of masks. This is against CDC guidelines, which state that \"CDC does not recommend using face shields or goggles as a substitute for masks.\" Face shields do not provide an adequate level of protection and unnecessarily put students and staff at risk.\nAt the school board meeting Wednesday, every physician who called in during public comment opposed full face-to-face. We should trust the advice of our medical professionals. Students should not be asked to put the health of ourselves and our loved ones at risk just to get an education. We, as students of the Hollidaysburg Area School District, refuse to go back in person and ask that the school board reconsider their decision.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/yz/um/TuYzUmhRjqNKJJq-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610637044"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/zach-klein-put-adam-coy-behind-bars-for-the-fatal-shooting-of-innocent-man-andre-hill?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Put Adam Coy behind bars for the fatal shooting of innocent man, Andre Hill.", "description": "Officers were dispatched to a \"non-emergency\" disturbance call from a neighbor who allegedly saw a man sitting in an SUV for an extended period of time, according to the Columbus Department of Public Safety.

GO TO https://linktr.ee/peaceforethiopia TO DONATE!\nOn Jun 29, 2020, and days after, there was a massive case of ethnic violence against innocent ethnic minorities, such as Amharas and Gurages, in the Oromo region after the murder of popular Oromo musician Hachalu Hundessa. This resulted in over 240 of these ethnic minorities being brutally murdered by Oromo extremists. Some organizations have reported on the dire situation that occurred in Ethiopia, while others have reported only on the government arresting several opposition leaders and political prisoners.\nThere is now much credible evidence released about the massacres that have been occurring in Ethiopia, particularly in the Oromo region, in which it is evident that several ethnic groups are suffering during this time from being under attack by groups that call themselves Queero. Businesses and homes owned by non-Oromos (Amhara, Gurage, Addis Ababa residents, etc.) have already been confirmed to be looted or burned, and there are more instances showing ethnically motivated killings. What has been occurring is not so different from what has happened during the October Massacre, in which over 80 Ethiopians were killed in one day by Queeros, extremist Oromo youth. The victims in these cases were ethnic/religious groups, such as Amharas, Hararis, Gurages, and Orthodox Oromos. This was a very strong religiously motivated massacre against Orthodox Christians. Churches were also destroyed and there is immense video evidence of this massacre. This massacre occurred because an Oromo politician, Jawar Mohammed, alleged on Facebook that government forces had arrested him, which later proved to be false. Thus, some of his admirers, the Queero, committed these atrocious crimes. Now that Jawar is actually arrested, the threat of several non-Oromo Ethiopians losing their lives is even higher.\nJawar has openly called for the deaths of Amhara people, Orthodox Christians, and other ethnicities in Ethiopia, and promotes ethnic cleansing and propaganda on OMN, the Oromo Media Network, which he is the Director of. It\u2019s true that he is an opposition leader. However, he has needed to be charged for his crimes against the Ethiopian people, and when the federal government encountered Jawar, there was a violent standoff between Jawar\u2019s people and the government forces, which led to his arrest. The government also stated that Jawar possessed several illegal weapons. In addition, when Hachalu died, his family requested that his body be sent to Ambo, which is his birthplace. This is a cultural tradition in Ethiopia, where people\u2019s bodies are buried in their hometowns. However, the government and several other sources have reported that Hachalu\u2019s fans in Addis Ababa and Jawar himself sought to prevent his body from being transported, which was against his family\u2019s wishes. This also caused an altercation with the federal forces. These events have been publicly announced by the government and are understood by Ethiopians who have been deeply following the news. This all is incredibly crucial and dangerous and has failed to be included in this organization\u2019s published findings.\nAuthorities should restore calm; however, excessive use of force by the government militia has been occurring, which has resulted in the unjust deaths of many Oromo protestors. At the same time, after Hachalu\u2019s death, many extremist Oromos on social media who praised Queeros, both in and especially outside of Ethiopia, have called for war in Ethiopia and violence against non-Oromos, particularly the Amhara people, which they suspected and even declared to be the killers of Hachalu. Amharas and non-Oromos (Gurages, Gamos, Gedeo, etc) who oppose extremism residing in the Oromo region are incredibly vulnerable to ethnic cleansing and general ethnic violence against them. In this case, the internet shut down in Ethiopia was likely a good thing since extremist views and calls for a massacre wouldn\u2019t have been as easily spread as it was during the October Massacre.\nAt the same time, many Oromos are suffering heavily at the hands of the government\u2019s military forces. In addition to mentioning how the government forces are using excessive force against Oromos protesting, mention how other Ethiopians are also suffering at the hands of the few extremist Oromo Ethiopians who are committing violent crimes against other ethnic groups.\nIn addition to the cases of ethnic violence in the Oromo region, there have also been several rounds of ethnic cleansing against Amharas and Agews in the Metekel zone of the Benishangul Gumuz region. On October 8th, Gumuz militia gunmen killed over 14 Amharas and Agews, and on September 24, they killed over 20 more. This took place less than two weeks after the huge massacre in which they killed over 89 Amhara and Agew civilians in the same Metekel Zone. Similar massacres took place in July, which left at least 14 dead. The latest case of ethnic cleansing against Amharas occurred when \u201cunidentified men opened fire on innocent civilians,\u201d on October 18 and October 21, leading to at least 31 Amhara civilians being massacred in the Gura Farda district of Bench Sheko zone in Southern Ethiopia. These cases are all confirmed by both eyewitnesses and regional and federal government officials, though the government denies that these are cases of constant ethnic cleansing, and doesn\u2019t provide protection or security to its people.\nThe most recent case of ethnic cleansing just occurred on November 1, 2020, in which the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), which is associated with the Oromo Liberation Front, massacred over 200 unarmed Amharas in West Wollega, Ethiopia. An estimated 40 OLA gunmen called Amhara residents in Dila Golala and Sekjerbi kebeles in the Gulala district of West Wollega for a meeting, and they opened fire on them. An unspecified number of people are also wounded and with life-threatening conditions. Women, children, the elderly, and the youth were all subjected to these killings, abductions, and injuries. Survivors state that a school and over 120 houses were set on fire. Bodies were not collected and relatives of the victims had been pleading to authorities to help collect littered bodies in the hope of organizing a funeral. Reports say that the Ethiopian Defense Force was deployed to the region for months due to the armed dangers of the OLA. Surviving witnesses said they begged the federal armed forces not to leave the area, but their pleas were not heard. OLA forces massacred the innocent and unarmed civilians after the Ethiopian Defence Forces withdrew from the region. The details are still coming out, however, the Oromo regional state communication bureau released a statement admitting the killing of civilians and blaming \u201cOLF/Shene\u201d and \u201cTPLF.\u201d However, there are speculations that the OLF is coordinating attacks in collaboration with its sympathizers in the Oromo region. There had been attempts by the Oromo regional government in the past to hide targeted attacks against Amharas.\nIn addition to the mentioned cases of ethnic cleansing against Amharas, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that several ethnic groups also suffer from ethnic violence, especially from Queeros, such as the Gamo, Gedeo, Walayta, Gurage, Zay, Dorze, Hararis, Siltes, and more. Also, in addition to Oromos suffering from excessive government force by the military, this has also been heavily experienced by Walaytas and Somalis. Somalis have constantly been killed by regional police, with there being no accountability or justice, which is the case for other Ethiopians who have been suffering from all of these violent forces. Afars have also been heavily suffering, as activists and officials state that militants and \u201cillegal settlers\u201d from the Issa Somali tribe are encroaching upon their land from the Somali region and Djibouti border, and attacking civilians. Somalis also claim the same grievances, as this is also a case of constant ethnic violence. The government hasn\u2019t provided any security or protection for them either. In all of these cases of violence, it\u2019s very important to emphasize that children and women are never spared and often face the bluntest of these killings. Sources documenting these cases will be attached below.\nOn behalf of the safety of all Ethiopians--and especially on the ethnicities that are currently facing unjust retaliation by Oromo extremists, such as the Queero-- We ned the government international and domestic to denounce, condemn, and investigate both the government\u2019s excessive use of force, and the ongoing ethnic motivated killings against Ethiopians that are happening throughout Ethiopia, and especially in the Oromo region. The government isn\u2019t taking any precautions to protect its people.

Collins, Francis W. O\u2019Brien and Joseph P. Shea - are moving forward with plans to lease 25 acres of Walpole\u2019s forest and farmland to a commercial solar development company, Kearsarge Energy. With precious little open space remaining in Walpole and across Norfolk County, the land in question holds great purpose and value beyond serving as a repository for solar panels. We are asking the County Commissioners to cooperate with the Walpole Preservation Alliance (WPA) and state and local agencies to create a fair and reasonable solution to satisfy the best interests and needs of the Town of Walpole, Norfolk County and their residents.\nThe project as proposed would take 17.5 acres of the fields and forest on North Street, and a further 7.5 acres of mature forest on the campus of Norfolk County Agricultural High School (\u201cthe Aggie\u201d), and convert those lands into large-scale solar plants. The existing trail system in both locations would be destroyed and the Aggie cross country course and Haunted Hayride route, along with the natural hands-on learning environment for a number of Aggie classes, would be eliminated.\nIn its presentation to the Walpole Select Board on 8/4/20, Kearsarge Energy omitted showing typical project details such as maintenance roadways up to and surrounding the solar panels and additional acres of tree clearing at the perimeter of the array to eliminate the casting of shadows on the panels. They also failed to show the path of interconnection lines from the array to the transmission lines, which typically consists of a pole-mounted overhead line next to a stabilized roadway able to support heavy maintenance vehicles. These things combined can occupy up to 60% or more land than the panels themselves.\nThis proposal is in direct contravention of the State\u2019s \u201cModel Zoning for the Regulation of Solar Energy Systems\u201d, published by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) in 2014 as follows: \"DOER strongly discourages locations that result in significant loss of land and natural resources, including farm and forest land, and encourages rooftop siting, as well as locations in industrial and commercial districts, or on vacant, disturbed land. Significant tree cutting is problematic because of the important water management, cooling, and climate benefits trees provide.\"\nThe Department\u2019s recommendation is clear. Large-scale solar projects should first utilize places like the rooftops of public buildings, landfills, and unused highway land, rather than farm and forest land.\nFurther, this proposal violates the Town\u2019s zoning laws and goes against a core objective of Walpole\u2019s 2020 Open Space and Recreation Plan: to \"encourage the preservation and conservation of agricultural parcels and large forested parcels and to identify\" and \"protect wildlife habitats and corridors, particularly those of endangered and threatened species\". It would also compromise the existing green corridor especially on the North Street fields, which sit on the border of BioMap2 land designated by MassWildlife as Core Habitat and Critical Natural Landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIt is ironic that Norfolk County, who has responsibility for teaching students to preserve and manage agricultural land, is proposing to lease a large part of their precious open space for a project that is in direct conflict with the State\u2019s own recommendations.\nConcerned neighbors under the banner of the Walpole Preservation Alliance (WPA) have worked individually and in concert with the Town of Walpole to reach a mutually beneficial arrangement with the County -- whereby the County would receive the money it is seeking and the Town would retain its open space. The County has refused all opportunities to pursue an alternative solution.\nWPA supports solar energy and the educational value it can provide to the students of Norfolk County Agricultural School, and we believe&nbsp;that educational objectives can be achieved&nbsp;with rooftop solar panels already in progress at the campus.&nbsp;\nIf, like us, you believe we should preserve this precious open space and site solar farms on previously disturbed locations, please sign and share this petition to show Norfolk County they are acting against your wishes.\nAdditional comments can be sent to Michael Mullen, Norfolk County Director at mmullen@norfolkcounty.org\nWe are grateful for your support,Walpole Preservation Alliance\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WalpolePreservationAlliance.org", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/ql/df/nFQldfJgvbmfclu-800x450-noPad.jpg?1604178958"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/niagara-arts-and-cultural-center-remove-yowawa-media-from-the-nacc?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Remove Yowawa Media From The NACC", "description": "Yowawa Media has been giving a platform to fascist groups who committed treason on January 6th by taking place in the failed coup at our Nation's capitol building.\nThe podcasts that they air are riddled with hate speech, transphobia, sexism and false information about the global pandemic.\nThe first amendment is absolutely important, but not when it is giving fascism a platform and when it encourages behavior that is a threat to the health and well being of everyone in our community.

By awarding Ricks you have dismissed the unethical actions of Eli Lilly and Company under his leadership.\nThere is currently an insulin price crisis in the United States. One that has existed for years and continues to be exacerbated by insulin manufactures, pharmacy benefit managers, and insurance companies. Eli Lilly and Company is a primary cause of this crisis.\nDuring Ricks\u2019 time at Eli Lilly, the price for one vial of Humalog, a popular analog insulin manufactured by Eli Lilly, increased by 1,480% (from $21 in 1999 to $332 in 2019 per vial). Many people living with insulin-dependent diabetes use two to four vials per month. This insulin price-hike is accompanied by no change to the insulin analog formula.&nbsp;\nI am a person living with Type 1 Diabetes. This means that my body does not produce insulin and I rely on injected insulin every day. Eli Lilly and Co. is one of three major companies that produce insulin in the U.S. Insulin is as necessary as oxygen. Every human being requires insulin to live, but for those of us with insulin-dependent diabetes, we have to pay exorbitant prices for this vital hormone.\nOur community has seen tragedy and death because of the high cost of insulin. Some have turned to online black-markets to share insulin. Some have tried Patient Assistance Programs only to be denied, confused, or left helpless. Some have sacrificed their careers, savings, and rent, all to afford insulin. Some have rationed their insulin causing life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis.&nbsp;\nOn June 27, 2017 the diabetes community lost Alec Smith, a 26 year-old man who was unable to afford his insulin. Out of this tragedy and hearts of advocates came a law in his honor, the Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act of Minnesota. Under this Act, Minnesota residents can access a 30-day emergency supply of insulin at the pharmacy for no more than $35. Hours before the legislation took effect on July 1, 2020, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, filed a lawsuit against Minnesota.&nbsp;\nDave Ricks serves on the board and is the chairman-elect of the PhRMA. Both PhRMA and Eli Lilly use lawsuits, patent abuse, and lobbying power to silence the efforts of patient advocates. Under the leadership of Ricks, they take advantage of our vulnerable community simply because they can.&nbsp;\nWords from the Diabetes Community\nThe company I work for was ranked #1 Best Place to Work in Indiana for 2020. Despite this I struggle to afford the Eli Lilly insulin that is manufactured in my hometown. Therefore, I am required to obtain Eli Lilly insulin through advocates online willing to supply me. When I cannot find insulin through my online diabetic community, I purchase Eli Lilly insulin from Canada at a fraction of the price. Because of this I do not feel that my life is valued by David Ricks, Eli Lilly or my local community.\n- Tommy LeStourgeon\nDuring my pregnancy I lost my job which resulted in me losing my insurance. Because I was pregnant though I was able to get on State insurance and was taken care of medically. 4 months after My son\u2019s birth my state insurance expired and my husband made too much to get back on state insurance but not enough for us as a family to afford health insurance that covered my diabetic needs. I was desperate. I had insulin but not enough to last more than 6 months. And no way could I afford $1500 a month on inulin. So Was forced to ration. This led to numerous DKA where I almost lost my life as well as Irreversible damage done to my eyes and kidneys. The fact that a drug that I need to be able to survive costs so much that I have to choose between feeding my son, being a present mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend is absolutely disgusting and sad. People are losing their lives over this. Eli Lilly should take this into consideration and lower their prices so this STOPS happening&nbsp;\n- Natalie Swanson&nbsp;\nI have struggled to survive due to the business practices of Eli Lilly under David Ricks leadership. I have had to buy insulin from Canada for $35 per vial shipped to me from Turkey. The insulin I received was the same Eli Lilly insulin that at my neighborhood pharmacy blocks from my house was almost $300 per vial. I have had to ration my insulin to make it last as long as I could. This leads to not controlling my blood sugar causing further complications that impact my life and finances as well. I ask as someone who lives with the struggle to survive daily due to David Ricks unethical business practices that you give this award to someone who shows Hoosier hospitality in their business practices towards the people not only of Indiana, but the world.&nbsp;\n- Craig Miller from Greenwood, IN\nI am deeply disturbed to see the Indiana Chamber of Commerce celebrate CEO Dave Ricks regardless of his company\u2019s unethical business practices. Furthermore, I expect you to hold the executives accountable for the actions of their companies. As a member of the diabetes community I ask the following of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce:\n\nAcknowledge the grievances of the diabetes community.\nMeet with an independent patient-led advocate coalition to discuss the unethical business practices of Eli Lilly and Company.&nbsp;\nUrge Dave Ricks and PhRMA to drop the lawsuit against the state of Minnesota.\nUrge Dave Ricks and Eli Lilly and Co. to substantially lower the list price of insulin.\nRevoke this award.&nbsp;\n\nTo conclude, I will leave you with the words of Sir Frederick Banting, a true leader who pioneered the extraction of insulin and sold its patent for $1. \u201cInsulin belongs to the world, not to me.\u201d\nCaylan Fazio\nType 1 Diabetic&nbsp;\nColumbus, Ohio\n&nbsp;\nPlease share this letter and petition with the hashtags #insulin4all and #ProtectAlecsBill.\nThose living with insulin-dependent diabetes (or caretakers) are welcome to reach out to me via social media to include your story and name in this open letter.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/ds/as/qkdSAsGAzCLcDjx-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605279169"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/save-el-pino-from-being-cut-down?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Save El Pino From Being Cut Down", "description": "El Pino is the heart of Boyle Heights and East LA.

Ms. Montgomery\u2019s execution is scheduled for December 8, 2020. Below is a statement from Kelley Henry, one of Ms. Montgomery\u2019s attorneys.\u201cFew human beings have lived through the kind of torture and trauma that was inflicted on Lisa Montgomery by her mentally ill, alcoholic mother. From a young age, Lisa was sexually trafficked, told she had to \u2018earn her keep,\u2019 and repeatedly gang raped by adult men. The abuses Lisa endured exacerbated a genetic predisposition to mental illness inherited from both sides of her family. She suffers from complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and to this day must maintain a complex regimen of anti-psychotic medications to control her episodic psychosis.\u201cIn the grip of her mental illness, Lisa committed a terrible crime. Yet she immediately expressed profound remorse and was willing to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence with no possibility of release. Lisa then was represented at trial by an incompetent lawyer who has the dubious distinction of having more clients on federal death row than any other attorney. He failed to present Lisa\u2019s jury with competent evidence about her traumatic history and severe mental illness, instead presenting pseudo-science through a witness who was not even a licensed mental health professional. And instead of recognizing Lisa as a trafficking victim, the government suggested she was complicit in the incest and abuse she suffered.\u201cLisa Montgomery has long accepted full responsibility for her crime, and she will never leave prison.

Carlos was victimized by an unjust judicial system whose scales are imbalanced framing African American men by a corrupt justice system.\nWE NEED YOUR SIGNATURE TO HELP FREE AN INNOCENT MAN, Carlos story is one of tainted trials and stolen justice. Carlos Harris was wrongfully convicted for the attempted murder of Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Carr, assault with a deadly weapon and robbery in concert on August 23, 2005. Carlos has maintained his innocence to date. Please sign this petition and share so we can present this to the Governor. Carlos has a family he needs to get back to: his wife, children and mother. Please read his story below.\nCarlos co-hosted a BBQ at a friends apartment complex labor day weekend in 2004. He invited his family and friends to join him and celebrate the holiday at a close friend\u2019s home. Carlos left the BBQ at the apartment complex early to meet up with a friend he ran into earlier that day. On the evening of the BBQ in the laundry room of Carlos friend\u2019s apartment complex Robert Bobby Carr was robbed and attacked by Carlos\u2019s co-defendants. Carlos was not aware of the attack until much later that evening when he was picked up down the street from the apartment complex by his wife and several associates (friends) who confessed to the setup, robbery and attempted murder of Robert Bobby Carr which Carlos was not apart of. Robert Bobby Carr recovered the attack and eventually submitted a written statement&nbsp; identifying his attackers and Carlos does not fit the description. The victim stated he never met/saw Carlos before.\nThe victim (Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Carr) was absent during the jury trial so Carlos was never able to face his accuser nor was he ever picked out in a police line up by the victim during the investigation. There were several eye witness statements that went ignored and they never made it to the witness stand during the trial. Carlos\u2019s guilty co-defendants perjured testimony and made deals with the District Attorney (DA) to receive light sentences.&nbsp; Also the ineffective court appointed representative never called any of the witnesses to take the stand during the jury trial that would have proved Carlos\u2019s innocence. There are multiple instances of inadequate counsel and poor representation in this case as well as direct mis-conduct and abuse of power from the District Attorney and presiding judge. As a result Carlos was convicted and sentenced to 28 years and 4 months in prison having served 16 years to date.\nCarlos has been fighting to prove his innocence since his conviction. Since then he filed an unsuccessful appeal and a writ of habeus corpus to prove his innocence and expose the mis-handling of his case from a legal standpoint as Carlos was sentenced to 28 years and 4 months, a double sentence based on an illegal enhancement that was enforced based on a prior conviction/plea agreement in 1991 that&nbsp; was never proved or stated at the time to be a strike and has nothing to do with the current case nor was deemed a violent crime.\nAll of Carlos\u2019s co-defendants took plea bargains and are out of prison and he has served 16 years of a 28 year sentence for a crime he did not commit. Carlos did not take the DA\u2019s deal because he is innocent. Carlos was railroaded during the trial:\nDuring the trial one of the jurors was biased, a former teacher that didn\u2019t like Carlos from high school.\nCarlos\u2019s due process rights were violated when the trial court informed the jury that he and the co-defendants were accomplices as a matter of law when he had not been proven guilty by the courts yet.\nCarlos requested a Marsden hearing during the trial and was denied counsel of his choice over the court appointed attorney due to a corrupt judicial system starting with the District Attorney and Judge that was presiding over his case. There were many instances of ineffective assistance of counsel and conflicts of interest during the trial (to many to list them all, multiple threats from the DA and judge toward Carlos, coerced testimonies, and not to mention the judge and the court appointed representative were close friends outside the courtroom and the public defendant withheld evidence that would have proved Carlos\u2019s innocence and kept several&nbsp; witnesses from testifying on Carlos\u2019s behalf.) Judicial Performance was requested and&nbsp; the judge retaliated against Carlos.\nAlso the courts abused its discretion during sentencing and Carlos\u2019s Romero motion was denied although he did not have a strike for a prior conviction in 1991 as the 3 strikes law did not go into effect until 1994 in California. The prior crime from 1991 was a misdemeanor and Carlos served 8 months in jail and was released based on a plea agreement. The court papers were altered and overlooked as we have written proof of the previous conviction.&nbsp;\nDespite all the injustices listed above we continue to fight for Carlos to be released. At this time we are requesting Carlos be released for time served (16 years) or exonerated. Carlos has served the full sentence for a crime he did not commit and is being detained illegally for a strike that does not exist.&nbsp; \nDonations made through this site support Change.org.&nbsp;PLEASE SUPPORT CARLOS'S DEFENSE FUND through Gofundme at https://www.gofundme.com/f/free-carlos-harris.

Courtney was raised in Plainfield, IL. She loved playing Rugby, cheerleading, Irish dancing, playing hockey and was adventurous. Courtney was also, a proud dog mama to her baby Harle.\nIn 2018, Courtney met a boy online, started dating &amp; moved down to Nakina, NC. The relationship started off good, but things became toxic. Courtney's boyfriend struggles with drug addiction. In September 2019, Courtney &amp; her partner got into a disagreement which resulted physical. According to the medical report impression-Courtney was beaten. The report read: facial laceration, facial contusion, mild concussion, laceration repair &amp; ASSAULT. This is an example of one of the many disagreements between the couple.\nFebruary 2, 2020 Courtney passed away in her home with her boyfriend present. Courtney's Cause of Death was an accidental Fentanyl and Heroin Intoxication. Courtney's&nbsp;autopsy diagnoses read; Fentanyl and Heroin intoxication, Pulmonary edema and congestion, Mild patchy bronchopneumonia, minor blunt force injuries to head, torso and extremities. Courtney\u2019s autopsy had multiple pages describing marks/bruises/gashes/broken bones. Unfortunately due to the circumstances of Courtney's Cause of Death, the case has been closed. No one from the Columbus County Sheriff's Office is returning her mother's phone calls.&nbsp;\nCourtney was not a drug user. There are several text messages and voice memos between the couple that Courtney is pleading for the boyfriend to stop using. Her pleading with him, caused explosive outbursts of anger towards her resulting in physical and mental abuse. &nbsp;According to the 911 call placed on February 2, 2020, the 911 dispatcher asked the boyfriend numerous times if there was any drugs involved. The boyfriend responded saying no, she never did drugs. Therefore, for someone who does not do drugs, for her to pass with drugs in her system it is VERY ALARMING. There was never a proper investigation completed.&nbsp;There was never a statement taken by the boyfriend for the incident that occurred on February 2, 2020.\nPlease stand with us- sign our petition to encourage the Columbus County Sheriff's Office to re-open Courtney Heater's Death Investigation.

I have been lucky enough to find that perfect dog and bond and create a life I honestly never imagined. To say he has saved my life on multiple occasions is an understatement. My Charlie is more in tune with me than I am with myself. Before Charlie I lost my family dog (Kobi) to old age which hit me extremely hard, he was my best friend since I was in 5th grade. After Kobi, my family gifted me with a German Shepherd puppy (Ramsay). Ramsay was in my life for about a month before he became suddenly ill and I lost him too. I was in no way ready to open my heart again until I saw Charlie. He was and always has been meant to be. Everything happened so I can find him and so he could change my life completely.&nbsp;\nI have always respected and understood the need for Service Dogs and think it's absolutely an amazing thing to offer for those who need it. As for Emotional Support animals, because they're not protected under the ADA there is nothing from making the ESA rules and regulations more strict, only left to ban. I think there are absolutely other solutions rather than banning them entirely. There are PLENTY of people who have ESA's who have NOT abused the privilege and have done right by it, including Charlie &amp; I. We traveled via aircraft, we go to stores, and public events and have never had and continue not to have any issues. We always work on socializing and obedience in public, we practice in busy settings and new settings. He also performs tasks naturally. He can sense when my stress and anxiety are more than normal and physically performs tasks such as, muzzling me (forcing me to pet him) he paws at me or he will even jump up to put his paws on my shoulder. In public I get social anxiety, when he senses it spike he rubs his head against me until I pet him which then reduces the stress. I know I'm not the only one lucky enough to experience this type of bond with their dog. We can find ways to help others out there like us who have done all the right things, but are being punished for the ones who decided they didn't want to pay for a pet fee for their peacock.&nbsp;\nThis past Christmas my family decided to rent an AirBnB. 24 hours upon arrival the owners/host changed their minds about me bringing along my ESA Charlie and charged us an extra $2500 in order for him to come. My family, knowing 100% he is more than just my pet paid it with no hesitation. It's instances like this that should not be allowed to happen. If Emotional Support Animals were protected under the ADA, rules and regulations would have to change completely making it more strict for people to have an official ESA and making it even harder to take advantage of.\nPlease help those who actually need this privilege and do right by it. I've done everything in my control to do right by my ESA and I will not be sticking him in cargo when we travel and should never have to pay $2500 to ensure he spends Christmas with me. I know we are not the only ones out there who would continue to do our duties as ESA owners and to ensure the banning of them doesn't happen.

Shortly after this incident, SJPD promoted Pina to Sergeant.&nbsp;\nWith Jacob gone, his entire family struggles with deep loss and disbelief. His mother grieves daily. They took her only son - her firstborn taken away from her in such a tragic and horrific way. Jacob\u2019s kids lost their daddy. His wife, a full time nurse has to try and pick up the pieces to raise their babies without their rock. His sister is left trying to explain to her son that his Brodie isn\u2019t coming back, that he\u2019s with Jesus. Losing Jacob has had a huge impact on their entire family. The cops judged him for his past, but we will all continue to fight for his future.\n#JusticeForMarissa&amp;Paea&nbsp;\nIn May of 2019, couple Marissa Santa Cruz and Paea Tukuafu were celebrating Marissa\u2019s 22nd birthday at a hotel in San Jose, CA.

Even after doing so, FIVE San Jose Police officers showed up and escalated it into violent interaction using batons, tasers and rubber bullets on Marissa and Paea. The couple suffered major injuries that required a trip to the hospital and spent the night in jail - with no criminal charges filed on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSergeant Mike Pina was there that night directing the other officers in this violent attack - He asked if they were on parole, threatened them with jail, pulled Marissa to the ground face first, shot them with tasers, and instructed other officers to attack this young couple.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n#FireSJPDOfficerMikePina\nMike Pina is a dangerous and reckless officer who should not be anywhere near our communities.

Juan was unarmed. Juan died of his injuries the following night, only hours after his family learned of the incident and was informed of his condition by hospital doctors. Juan\u2019s sons were not allowed in the hospital to say goodbye to their father.\nJuan was a sweet and loving partner and father who adored his family. He was also a talented and well-respected chef in the Napa Valley restaurant industry. Juan\u2019s kind and generous nature brought him to the Napa Valley Commons area the night of October 5th, delivering pizzas to friends evacuated during the Glass Fire, where he was later shot and ultimately killed by Sgt. Ackman. Juan\u2019s killing is unjustifiable and has destroyed his family.&nbsp;\nThe Napa County Major Crimes Task Force, consisting of the Napa County District Attorney\u2019s Office, the Napa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the Napa Police Department, are conducting their own investigation of the incident but have thus far failed to release critical evidence to the attorneys representing Juan\u2019s family. There is no peace for his family but rather a litany of unanswered questions and a resolve to fight for justice for their beloved father, husband, son, brother, and friend. Juan\u2019s family, friends, and the community demand transparency in the investigation into his killing as well as accountability for Sgt. Ackman\u2019s actions, specifically that:\no&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete body camera footage as well as the dashboard camera footage from Sgt. Ackman\u2019s patrol car must be released to the family attorneys. Only the partial body camera footage that was released to the public was shared with the family.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; The security camera footage from the neighboring businesses adjacent to where the shooting took place must be released to the family attorneys. The Napa County Major Crimes Task Force has refused to release the security camera footage to the family attorneys and have coordinated amongst themselves to suppress said footage.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; Juan\u2019s autopsy report must be immediately released to the family attorneys. The Sheriff\u2019s Office has refused to release the autopsy report making it impossible for the family to finalize Juan\u2019s death certificate. Furthermore, officers prevented the family from documenting Juan\u2019s injuries in the little time they had with him in the hospital. Their time with him was limited because officers prioritized interrogating the family rather than informing them that Juan was in the hospital or of his injuries. It is crucial that the autopsy report be released immediately.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; An outside, independent task force and special prosecutor must be called in to investigate Juan\u2019s killing and Sgt. Ackman\u2019s actions to prevent any type of coverup. The Sheriff\u2019s Office has already defended Sgt. Ackman\u2019s actions. Their claims that Sgt. Ackman attempted to deescalate the situation differ greatly from the released body camera footage. Furthermore, prosecutors in the DA\u2019s Office work with local law enforcement on a daily basis, making it very difficult for them to prosecute one of their own. The DA\u2019s Office claims that it will take them approximately six months to decide if charges will be brought against Sgt. Ackman. This is in addition to the six to eight months it will take the Sheriff\u2019s Office to conclude their own investigation. In contrast, the decision to bring criminal charges against a civilian shooter would be decided in days. An independent investigation is necessary.\nWe demand transparency in the investigation into Juan\u2019s unjustifiable killing and demand that Sgt. Ackman be held accountable for his actions. As a community we want to feel safe and assured that an officer, especially a sergeant with 21 years of experience in the department, would use every other measure available to deescalate and prevent such a senseless killing of an unarmed man. Juan leaves behind three sons, the youngest of only seven years, who will continue to live and grow in the Napa community. Please add your name to this petition to demand justice for Juan and to demand a better and safer community for Juan\u2019s sons. &nbsp;\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nEn la noche del 5 de octubre de 2020, a Juan Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, un residente de Napa de 47 a\u00f1os de edad y padre de tres hijos, le dispar\u00f3 varias veces el sargento del alguacil del condado de Napa David Ackman despu\u00e9s de una parada de tr\u00e1fico rutinaria.

Tambi\u00e9n era cocinero talentoso y muy respetado en la industria de los restaurantes del valle de Napa. Su humor amable y generoso le trajo al \u00e1rea de los Napa Valley Commons la noche del 5 de octubre, llevando pizza a sus amigos evacuados por el incendio Glass, d\u00f3nde despu\u00e9s le dispar\u00f3 y \u00faltimamente fue asesinado por Sgt.

El asesinato de Juan es injustificable y ha destruido a su familia.\nEl comando de los cr\u00edmenes mayores del condado de Napa, contando con la oficina de la fiscal del condado de Napa, la oficina del alguacil del condado de Napa y el departamento de polic\u00eda de Napa, est\u00e1n llevando a cabo su propia investigaci\u00f3n del incidente, pero hasta el momento ha fallado a proporcionar evidencia crucial a los abogados representando a la familia de Juan.

La familia de Juan, sus amigos y la comunidad exigen la transparencia en la investigaci\u00f3n del asesinato de \u00e9l adem\u00e1s de hacer responsable al Sgt.

El comando de los cr\u00edmenes mayores del condado de Napa se ha rechazado entregar el metraje de las c\u00e1maras de seguridad a los abogados de la familia y se ha coordinado entre ellos mismos para ocultarlo.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; Se entrega inmediatamente el reporte de la autopsia de Juan a los abogados de la familia. La oficina del alguacil se ha rechazado entregar el reporte de la autopsia haci\u00e9ndole imposible finalizar el acta de fallecimiento de Juan. Adem\u00e1s, los oficiales del comando le impidieron a la familia documentar las heridas de Juan en el poco tiempo con \u00e9l en el hospital. Su tiempo con \u00e9l fue limitado porque los oficiales del comando priorizaron la interrogaci\u00f3n de la familia de Juan en vez de notificarle que estaba en el hospital o de sus heridas. Es crucial que se entrega el reporte de la autopsia inmediatamente.\no&nbsp;&nbsp; Se interviene un comando independiente y desde afuera y un fiscal especial para investigar el asesinato de Juan y las acciones del Sgt. Ackman para prevenir cualquier encubrimiento. La oficina del alguacil ya ha defendido las acciones del Sgt. Ackman. Su afirmaci\u00f3n de que el Sgt. Ackman intent\u00f3 reducir la escala de la situaci\u00f3n se difiere mucho del metraje de la c\u00e1mara del cuerpo publicado. Adem\u00e1s, los fiscales de la oficina de la fiscal trabajan diariamente con los cuerpos policiales locales haci\u00e9ndole dif\u00edcil procesar uno de ellos mismos. La oficina de la fiscal dice que tomar\u00e1 aproximadamente seis meses en decidir si llevar\u00e1 a cabo cargos al Sgt. Ackman.

In addition, we request acceleration lanes at the same intersection and at the intersection of Red Leaf Blvd. and Highway 52.\nFoxbank Plantation includes almost 1,500 homes with many more planned or under construction. Not only do the residents of the neighborhood use this intersection every day, but there is also an elementary school with its associated traffic, a fire station, a daycare, and a growing number of businesses that all use this intersection daily. A new Parker\u2019s gas station is also being built at that location, which will draw in even more vehicles. With the addition of a traffic light, not only would the number of accidents decrease significantly, but the school traffic would be more easily controlled and the fire department would be able to more easily exit the neighborhood in the event of an emergency. Traffic coming out of Moncks Corner would also be improved without the frequent collisions blocking traffic. This would benefit not only Foxbank residents, but residents of surrounding neighborhoods and first responders.&nbsp;\nAt present, there are multiple vehicle collisions at the intersection of Foxbank Plantation Blvd. and Highway 52 every month. Anyone that tries to exit at this intersection is aware of how difficult it can be at times; turning right onto Highway 52 involves accelerating from a stop to 60 MPH while avoiding oncoming vehicles, and is further complicated when a vehicle trying to turn left at the same intersection blocks the view of oncoming traffic. Likewise, vehicles turning into the neighborhood from Highway 52 are often met with a long line, particularly when Foxbank Elementary releases students for the day. Matters are further complicated when a vehicle is exiting the storage facility across from the neighborhood entrance, as they use the same median area. It is only a matter of time until there is a major accident and people are seriously injured or killed. With the presence of the school and daycare, unfortunately the chances of a child being involved in a serious accident is compounded.\nTherefore, it is our suggestion that additional traffic studies be completed at the intersections of Highway 52 and Foxbank Plantation Blvd. and Highway 52 and Red Leaf Blvd. We also suggest the installation of a traffic light at the Foxbank Plantation Blvd. exit as well as acceleration lanes at both intersections. With the growing number of homes and businesses, the problem will only become worse until something is done.

But I also think Texans would agree that we take pride in what we do and expect others to do the same.

I thought, \u201cthis isn\u2019t the way we do things here.\u201d I felt deceived when I read on Wingstop\u2019s website that \u201cTreating animals well is important to our guests and our company...We value suppliers that take a continuous improvement approach to animal welfare, and we consider that in making our sourcing decisions.\u201d After doing some research, I realized that Wingstop was saying one thing and doing something very, very different.\nCurrently, chickens raised for Wingstop\u2019s supply chains live a life of pure torture. They are bred to grow at an alarmingly unnatural rate, which causes leg deformities, organ failure, and heart attacks in these baby birds. Each flock, which consists of tens of thousands of birds, are kept in dirty, windowless sheds. They are forced to live in their own waste with ammonia levels so concentrated that many suffer from chemical burns. When these birds are brought to slaughter, they are violently shackled upside down. Their throats are then slit, often while they\u2019re still conscious.\nBut Wingstop has the opportunity to vastly improve the lives of the chickens it uses for the meat on its menu by adopting the Better Chicken Commitment, a comprehensive set of welfare reforms that address the worst abuses suffered by chickens on today\u2019s farms. Over 200 companies have already signed on to this commitment, and I believe that Wingstop should join!\nConsumers across the globe are demanding more transparency about the sources of their food\u2014especially with regard to animal welfare. In response, restaurants, from Burger King to TGI Fridays to White Castle are stepping up to the plate and committing to doing better.&nbsp;\nI hope you will join me in urging Wingstop to keep moving in the right direction for its customers, the animals in its supply chain, and the planet\u2014and to do a better job at representing Texas.\nWingstop: please adopt the Better Chicken Commitment!", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/ru/jt/gZruJTjqNxLmHFM-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609982651"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/president-stuart-bell-the-university-of-alabama-cancel-in-person-classes-mandate-covid-testing?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "The University of Alabama - Cancel In-Person Classes &amp; Mandate COVID Testing", "description": "After winning the National Championship on Monday evening, a crowd of UA students and Bama supporters crowded the Strip in celebration.

He was carded and had a fake Id. Even the officers questioned his identity due to the id found on him. They were provided with the bar tab showing NO EVIDENCE of him being over served!

The owner and employees have been nothing but helpful and willing to cooperate to find out what happened that night. Yes we have had problems with citations but NOT DUE TO OVER SERVING, CARDING, or SERVING TO MINORS!

No signs of even being intoxicated while at the bar let alone being overly intoxicated! The Barbee Landing has NOT had a reoccurrence of police being called, underage serving, or over serving now or prior to this incident! He entered other bars with same id and served! Only because there was video of him leaving Barbee Landing they are being punished! HE AND HIS FRIEND CASHED OUT AND LEFT FOR SOME TIME THEN RETURNED.

Over the past couple years applications for these permits has skyrocketed and Connecticuts Department of Energy and Environmental Protection involvement has dwindled. Any person or company in the world can legally apply for a permit to Connecticut DEEP for any reason and get a rubber stamp approval. If no approval is given, there is also a loophole within the current laws that if no response is given to applicant within 24 hours, it is deemed automatically approved. These herbicide applications are approved under the guise of treating the invasive species Milfoil. An aquatic plant which has been in mostly all water bodies in CT for decades.\nThe problem with the herbicides is tenfold. The&nbsp;treatment process is never supervised. Often companies use much larger doses and cover much larger areas than permitted on application. The herbicides often used destroy all vegetation in its path eliminating habitat for fish, shellfish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, etc. Several times anglers throughout the state have witnessed fish kills on the Housatonic Water Shed, mainly Lake Lillinonah. When brought to the attention of DEEP, they turn a blind eye and ignore it then deny it ever happened. Companies that spray these chemicals claim spot treatment is possible. This is not the case on river systems as current drifts the chemical downstream of the application. Another key issue that has been overlooked is the detrimental affect these herbicides have on pets such as dogs. Veterinarians across the state have been seeing a rise in cases of Gastroenteritis. Not only from swimming in lakes that have been treated but also from small ponds. Areas where dogs get small amounts of exposure over long periods of time. Aquatic vegetation is waters natural filter, by eliminating it water clarity drops dramatically and also creates a environment for the toxic blue-green algae blooms to occur and flourish. The State of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection recognizes studies that show, herbicide applications greatly increases the risk of deadly Cyanobacteria Outbreaks by a factor of six.\nCompanies that execute these treatments consistently fail to notify the public, post proper signage, use proper dosages, exceed scope of application area, and are never held accountable. This creates a very hazardous situation for residents who wish to enjoy time on the water unknowingly exposing themselves to these hazardous chemicals. Exposure to humans can cause respiratory failure, severe&nbsp;irritation of the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach. May induce&nbsp;vomiting, diarrhea, severe dehydration and&nbsp;body fluid imbalance. Diquat itself has been found to cause liver and kidney damage, cataract, pupil dilation and severe skin allergies such as excessive rashes and burns. Exposure may trigger malaise, chest pain and even death.\nFishing is a multi-billion dollar industry in which Connecticut is losing tens of millions in revenue annually due to the detrimental affects herbicides have. The quality of fishing on bodies of water that have been treated with herbicides has declined drastically. To the point fishing license sales have fallen, local businesses have closed their doors, and fishing guides have seen a drop in clients.\nCandlewood Lake, notably one of the top bass fisheries in the country is thriving more than ever. It\u2019s the only lake we have that has not been treated. Needless to say it would be catastrophic to the fishery and the local economy if herbicides found their way in.\nThe main reason these herbicide treatments are occurring on public water bodies is that lake front property owners and non U.S. citizens do not want weeds near the docks they own or rent. There are several safe methods these individuals can use to achieve this. During winter drawdowns rubber mats can be installed to prevent vegetation from growing. Mechanical harvesting using machines is common throughout the country. Manual extraction by licensed aquatic landscapers is efficient and contributes to local economies. The list goes on and on.&nbsp;\nWith this petition we are calling on Connecticut legislators to once and for all propose and pass legislation creating a ban on the use of all chemical herbicides and pesticides on public bodies of water. These beautiful natural resources belong to all Connecticut residents, not only a few. We wish to keep these ecosystems healthy and flourishing for generations to come.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ii/mf/BDiimfWZgKRlSoZ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1602512451"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/sony-pictures-studios-dedicate-jeopardy-stage-at-sony-pictures-studios-to-alex-trebek?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Dedicate 'Jeopardy!'

His behavior is textbook and it is being reflected in our Nation\u2019s Capitol right now as GOP leaders demand that they be immediately forgiven and allowed to remain in positions of power despite their participation in creating the chaos that occurred on January 6th.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nI will not address Pastor Berger\u2019s claims that he was in DC for meetings before January 6th and that he did not attend the action at the Capitol because, after taking a look through his social media, I can see that he has, for many years, been involved directly with the Trump administration and no amount of backtracking after January 6th can erase this collaboration.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nIt is very telling to me that Steve Berger did not condemn white supremacy, Donald Trump, or fascism in his \u201capology\u201d. In fact, instead of actually apologizing for his role in supporting the fascist President, he decided to deflect, insisting that he is owed apologies for those who have attempted to slander him. He\u2019s also made claims that folks are making false allegations against him and that people haven\u2019t reached out to him before making statements. I personally know people who have been in contact with his office and have confirmed that he has refused to make a comment when they\u2019ve reached out. As many of us have seen since the beginning of the Trump administration, white supremacy has been the motivating factor for so much of Trump\u2019s supporter base. It is impossible to argue at this point that anyone can support Donald Trump and NOT support white supremacy.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nI am a strong believer in transformative justice and reconciliation. I myself was raised in the church, and understand the importance of truthful communication and the power of forgiveness. I understand that humans make mistakes, and that everyone should be given the opportunity to change and turn away from harmful&nbsp; actions. However, this requires ACTUAL repentence, not name calling, finger pointing, or lack of accountability. This is the motivating factor behind my demand that Pastor Steve Berger be removed from his position at Grace Chapel Church. I believe that his lack of self-accountability and his refusal to accept responsibility in supporting the Trump administration and promoting it in his church is not only unacceptable, it is dangerous. Donald Trump fomented insurrection at the Capitol that resulted in the deaths of 5 people. Pastor Steve Berger has condemned the \u201cviolent acts\u201d at the Capitol but has not condemned President Trump, at all and immediately after the event, made baseless claims trying to deflect responsibility from the real perpetrators.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nI feel it is is unhealthy for our community to have leaders in positions of power who refuse to take accountability for their actions. I believe a true leader and follower of Jesus Christ, would graciously admit to the entirety of his mistakes, not just pick and choose in order to make himself not seem culpable. I believe that someone who has such pull should openly admit that he has been promoting a white supremacist president, de-platform himself, and center the voices of those who have been harmed by the Trump administration and its supporters. We do not want community leaders who refuse to take responsibility and who shame those who ask for accountability. We ask for the resignation of Pastor Steve Berger and for Grace Chapel Church in Franklin, TN to publicly condemn his participation in the events of January 6th. We are in incredibly tension filled times, and now more than ever it is important to denounce fascism and white supremacy and ask those who refuse to denounce to be removed from positions of power.

However, Herrell is not new to undermining elections, as she previously attempted to impound legal absentee ballots in The 2018 Mid-Term Elections in the state of New Mexico.\nThrough her seditious behavior, lack of understanding of the United States Constitution, and unwavering support for an unstable and dangerous President, Herrell has proven that she does not possess the personal constitution to make reasonable and educated decisions for her State and its Citizens.&nbsp;Her repeated behavior is perilous to The State of New Mexico, The United States of America, and democracy itself.&nbsp;\nBy removing Rep.

The brand new superintendent of Padre Island National Seashore, a man who is not a scientist, has endorsed a Review that will gut and defund the Kemp's ridley sea turtle program run by Dr. Donna Shaver, a celebrated scientist.&nbsp;\nUnless the public speaks out now and demands this Review be withdrawn, the successful program that protects the Kemp's ridley sea turtle will be a remnant of what it is now.&nbsp; The two primary nesting locations for this most endangered of sea turtles are Padre Island National Seashore and a beach in Mexico. Reducing this program in Texas will reduce the Kemp's ridley population and put the entire species at even higher risk of extinction.Dr. Shaver was not invited to contribute to or even read the Review which will decimate the sea turtle program at Padre Island National Seashore. She is the foremost authority on the Kemp's ridley turtle and it is her sea turtle program. Instead, she was preemptively placed under a gag order not to comment before the Review was ever released. She may not be able to comment, but her whistle blower complaint says plenty. Dr. Shaver, who is celebrated worldwide, is sacrificing her career in an an effort to save these sea turtles.Here are a few of the damaging changes requested in the Review.The superintendent wants a 30% reduction in funding for the sea turtle program.\nThe superintendent wants to cut back the popular public hatchling release program which showcases Dr. Shaver's &amp; others' work saving the Kemp's ridley sea turtle and which brings in approximately one million dollars in annual tourist revenue to Corpus Christi, Texas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although all sea turtles are endangered, the superintendent wants all work to save other species of sea turtles at the park prohibited. If sea turtle eggs are not collected and protected at the Padre Island National Seashore, there is a 100% chance they will be destroyed. This ruling means any green sea turtle eggs or loggerhead sea turtle eggs laid at the beach will be left to be destroyed by vehicles, fire ants, or coyotes.&nbsp; Any cold-stunned or injured green or loggerhead turtles must be left in place, likely to die of predation or injury.&nbsp; After years of helping sea turtles, volunteers and scientists are being ordered to turn their backs and ignore them.Even though public comment was legally required for this Review, no public comment was requested or allowed. As you see, they even gagged the top scientist! This petition is our attempt to redress that and make a public comment.&nbsp; Members of the public fish, camp, and go birding at this national park. You have to drive on the beach for all of these activities. The proposed changes would either prohibit driving April 1 - July 15, or, at a minimum, require an additional permit fee on top of the park entrance fee. These proposals are in the report and acknowledge the state must be consulted.&nbsp; They are the argument for defunding the sea turtle program. The argument is wrong, but the argument is you can defund the program because there will be no driving on the beach.&nbsp;We believe in following the money to determine the reason behind this incomprehensible and destructive proposal. It appears the National Park Service would like to ban all traffic on the beach, ending camping and recreational fishing, and telling the public that nests on the beach are now safe, so they can reclaim the funds that were specifically granted for the turtle program and use those funds for other purposes. &nbsp;In fact, any nests left on the beach would not be safe.&nbsp; 100% would be predated by coyotes, fire ants, or other wildlife.&nbsp; Vehicles are only one of the threats to turtle nests. Banning traffic and dismantling the turtle program ends birding, fishing, and camping, as well as destroying endangered Kemp ridley sea turtles.\nHowever, under the original agreement between the state of Texas and the U.S. Government, if traffic is prohibited on the beach, the park will revert to the state. It may be that the National Park Service does not think Texas will try to reclaim the park land or perhaps the National Park Service no longer wants this park. In any event, if the park reverted to the state, it might no longer be a park, but might be developed.\nEither way, a way of life on Padre Island National Seashore is being threatened, not only for turtles, but also for tourists and residents.&nbsp;The sea turtles which nest at Padre Island National Seashore don't&nbsp; belong to the park or to Texas. They are protected by the National Park Service which should be stewards for them.&nbsp; In this case, the stewardship has failed, so contact your Senators and Representatives and object to this travesty.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, the final insult of the Review is this: \"research activities be removed from the Chief of the&nbsp;Division of Sea Turtle Science and Recovery and be placed under the direct control of a nonscientist, the park superintendent.\" That is right, take the scientific program away from control by scientists and give it to a career park employee who is an administrator, not a scientist.We demand this Review be withdrawn and any future Reviews be a collaboration with park scientists, as well as management, and that future Reviews be released for public comment, as is required by law,&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/ky/at/uikyATfmpLHQada-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607228194"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/westminster-locals-get-rafs-their-liquor-license-back?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Get Rafs their Liquor License Back", "description": "Rafs liquor license was suspended after a trial that was inadequately heard.

More than half of all American households own dogs, and according to The Harris Poll (2015), 96% of them consider them to be another member of the family. The loss of a dog, by death or theft, is an emotionally tolling experience that leaves families suffering.&nbsp;\nOn the other hand, it's not just families that suffer. Dogs are sentient beings, not inanimate objects. In a New York Times column, Gregory Berns, a neuroscientist and author, tells how he and his team used MRIs to decode the canine brain, with initial findings showing evidence that dogs empathize with humans, and are capable of experiencing positive emotions, like love and attachment.&nbsp;\nIt is estimated that around 2 million dogs are stolen each year in the US. Criminals are becoming more violent, attracted by the hefty rewards their heartbroken victims will offer to get back their canine family members. The weak dog theft laws that are in place in California are allowing criminals to operate with little accountability for their heinous acts, and are putting dog owners in danger.&nbsp;\nLet's ask the California State Legislature to pass dog theft laws that will reflect the irrecoverable damage done to all the victims, and that can serve as a deterrent for future crimes.

The BMI, originally known as the Quetelet Index, remains largely unchanged since its creation in the 1800s by a sociologist--not a medical doctor. It was intended to be used as a statistical tool to measure populations, not to diagnose health in individuals. Its creator, a Belgian named Adolphe Quetelet, sought to quantify \"the average man\" and enlisted only white, European men when developing his Index.&nbsp;\nThe resultant prescription of weight loss based on an individual's BMI is consistently met by severe resistance from the body which then launches a complex, multi-system effort to restore the lost weight over time. Ninety-eight percent of dieters will gain back all the weight they lost, and up to two-thirds of individuals will gain more weight over a period of three to five years. The evidence for this is as strong as the evidence that smoking causes cancer (level A). Additionally, there is evidence that an \"obesity paradox\" exists in which patients living with a growing list of chronic diseases who have higher percentages of body fat live longer than their thinner counterparts.&nbsp;\nDue to the BMI's racist and patriarchal roots, Black and brown women are most disproportionately affected.&nbsp; This contributes to systemic weight-based discrimination and increases morbidity and mortality rates among people of color.

They further claim that they \"communicate openly, honestly, and reliably\", and that they provide \"access to timely and reliable information on decisions and performance\".\nI ask you to join me in asking EBRPD to honor their own values. &nbsp;\nWhere was their empathy when they sent rangers out with guns?\nWhere was the teamwork they cultivate with their colleagues and partners when they carried this out without consulting with a single shelter or rescue group? &nbsp;\nHow can they claim that they communicate openly and honestly with the public they serve when they (separately and on more than one occasion) told Cecelia and another colony caretaker that they had not killed the cats, but had taken them to shelters in Oakland and Dublin? &nbsp;Most of the colony cats were not only spayed, neutered and vaccinated - they were also microchipped by Fix Our Ferals. &nbsp;Had even a single one arrived alive at any shelter or veterinary hospital, they would have immediately been scanned for chips, and the organization would have been notified. &nbsp;Even knowing that to be true, Cecelia and the other caretaker held out hope and spoke with both shelters. &nbsp;Needless to say, neither had received any cats from EBRPD. &nbsp;As Oakland Animal Services' Director Ann Dunn made clear when interviewed by ABC7, she wasn't even aware of the cats because EBRPD never consulted with OAS or any other shelter or rescue group.\nIf EBRPD truly provides access to timely and reliable information on their decisions, why is it that they still haven't supplied any records documenting any of the killings, carried out on multiple&nbsp;occasions, in multiple parts of the district, even though ABC7's team filed a California Public Records Act request for these documents?\nMatt Graul, EBRPD's Chief of Stewardship, claims that he and his staff \"feel horrible about this\" and that they \"really don't want to ever have to take this step\". &nbsp;Perhaps it was as OAS Director Ann Dunn said, and EBRPD were unaware that Oakland Animal Services were a resource. &nbsp;Perhaps they were also unaware of FAAS (Friends of the Alameda Animal Shelter), and they didn't know about ICRA (Island Cat Resources and Adoption). &nbsp;None were ever contacted by EBRPD, and all three organizations immediately pledged to help when they were made aware of what EBRPD was doing. &nbsp;Assuming that park officials truly felt horrible, assuming they truly saw no other way, assuming they had the best of intentions but simply didn't know that they had allies and options -- assuming all that to be true, then why did they tell Dan Noyes that they would not pledge to stop shooting cats?\nAgain, I hope you will join me in asking East Bay Regional Park District to honor their own values. &nbsp;I have never met Cecelia, but several months ago, she humanely trapped two cats and their two kittens. &nbsp;The adult male was neutered, the adult female was spayed; they were both vaccinated and microchipped and returned to their colony. &nbsp;The two kittens ended up being fostered&nbsp;by me. &nbsp;It is their photo that is attached to this petition. &nbsp;They have since been adopted together into a loving home, where they are providing comfort and joy to a family and their sixteen-year-old cat who were all grieving the recent loss of their other senior cat. &nbsp;Those kittens' parents were shot and killed by EBRPD. &nbsp;When I was made aware of what had happened, I will admit I was extraordinarily angry; I was deeply disappointed in EBRPD, and I was truly heartbroken. &nbsp;Just as Ann Dunn said, I too am still heartbroken \"just knowing that there's no reason (these shootings) needed to happen\". &nbsp;I am still heartbroken, but more than anything I am very determined to do what I can to ensure that this doesn't happen again. &nbsp;Please sign my petition and ask EBRPD to work with all the rescue groups and individuals who have stepped up and offered their help and their resources. &nbsp;Please ask them to pledge to stop shooting cats.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/bj/iu/bFbJIuMbxNvoCwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607343194"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/broken-arrow-city-council-masking-in-broken-arrow-ok?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Masking in Broken Arrow OK", "description": "The Broken Arrow City Council must take additional steps to protect our community from Covid-19.

The B.1.17 mutated strain of the virus has been discovered in the United States. It has resulted in an extreme lock down in Great Britain.\nThe White House SARS-CoV-2 Task Force, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institutes for Health, in addition to local and state health departments and physicians, all consistently produce figures from quantitative scientific research, showing measurable effects of mask-wearing in cities. The results of this research prove that wearing masks does indeed slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The current lack of a policy is a failure to protect citizens, particularly those who must work in the public and risk exposure to the airborne virus from an unmasked pubic repeatedly throughout the day. Every statistic on transmission in Broken Arrow has risen to extraordinary levels. Nearly any added emphasis on mask wearing would be an improvement.\n\nWe support a mask ordinance to help schools and businesses remain open both, deserve our support.&nbsp;\nWe support a city-wide mask ordinance because Broken Arrow is not an \u201cisland\u201d within the Greater Tulsa area, and the infectious climate here contributes to area hospitals and ICU units being overwhelmed and medical personnel being taxed to a breaking point. If the contagion gets worse what we do now can prevent the eventual collapse of our health system.\nWe support a city-wide mask ordinance because the first goal of any level of effective government is the protection of the community it is called to govern.\nWe support a mask ordinance because, the unequivocal support of city leaders to this basic public health strategy is important to encourage mask wearing.\nWe support a city-wide mask mandate because our masks protect you, and your masks will protect us. The higher the percentage of people wearing masks, the lower the rate of spreading the infection.We support a mask ordinance because endangering the health and lives of others by refusing to wear a mask is not the Oklahoma Standard of caring for and helping one another.\n", "image_url": "https://static.change.org/profile-img/default-user-profile.svg"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/wadsworth-police-department-help-bring-my-brother-iron-cannon-home-been-missing-since-october-17-2020?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Help bring my brother Iron Cannon home been missing since October 17, 2020", "description": "I AM ASKING FOR A DEMAND ON BRINGING MY BROTHER HOME AND FOR JUSTICE TO BE SERVED.\nWE HAVE BEEN WAITING WAY TO LONG FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO BE DONE AND CLOSER FOR THE FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY AS WELL.\nTHE POLICE DIDN'T GET INVOLVED UNTIL 2 WEEKS AFTER IRON CANNON WAS REPORTED MISSING.

Throughout the country high school sports associations have collaborated with state officials to offer student-athletes opportunities to engage in the extracurricular activities they love, and have trained for throughout their high school years. Those collaborations have allowed students to hold on to some semblance of normalcy during the most chaotic period of their young adult lives. Everywhere except Illinois.&nbsp;\nIn Illinois, Illinois High School Association officials and members of the Illinois Department of Public Health and Governor J.B. Pritzker's office has all shown immense failures in leadership. Mistakes and miscalculations have led to petty bickering through the press and failed to produce a cohesive plan, all while harming student-athletes that mitigations and&nbsp; guidance is \u201csupposedly enacted to protect\u201d. While the past cannot be rewritten or regrets undone, there is still time left in the 2020-21 school year to provide student-athletes meaningful extracurricular experiences. Those who have signed and publicized this petition, coaches, players, parents, and supporters would request the IHSA, IDPH and JB Pritzker to do the following:&nbsp;\nPublicly apologize through a joint statement to student- athletes throughout the state of Illinois for the mismanagement of this situation. At the bare minimum, the lack of consistent communication and a cohesive plan had created an unnecessary atmosphere of anxiety, depression and fear, that is not a result of COVID-19, but a failure in leadership.&nbsp;\n\nEstablish a set of safety mitigations, specific to each offered activity through the IHSA, that will protect student-athletes, coaches, parents, officials, and event workers to the best of your ability.&nbsp;Revise and publish a new calendar of extracurricular activities grounded in the following principles:\nAssign all sports, regardless of their traditional season assignment (fall, winter, or spring), to a time in the calendar that gives each of them the best opportunity to be conducted in a safe and meaningful manner.&nbsp;\nProvide all students with an opportunity to participate in at least one sport during this school year, even if sports conflict with one another.

Despite initially being offered a plea deal, Greg maintained his innocence the entire time. He has now been in prison for 39 years.\nMy life has been shaped by my uncle\u2019s incarceration. Uncle Greg missed my birth, but when I was four, my parents moved to Westchester, NY so we could be closer to where he was imprisoned. I\u2019ve felt his absence in every milestone of my life since then. He missed my graduations from high school and Harvard. He could not be there on my wedding day.&nbsp;\nAnd for what? There was no physical evidence in the case against Greg, and his court-appointed defense lawyer failed to present an alibi witness who had agreed to testify on his behalf. Only a Black man in New York in the 1980s could have been convicted on such thin allegations and sent away for so long.\nThe average time served in state prison for a murder conviction is 15 years. Greg\u2019s sentence of 50 years to life is staggering; what some refer to as \u201cdeath by incarceration.\u201d\nUncle Greg grew up in a system rife with injustice. Just five months after sentencing Greg, Queens Supreme Court Justice Thomas Agresta used the N-word in open court in reference to a Black defendant. His gross, public ethical violation was so egregious that Justice Agresta was censured a year later, and has since been used as an example in legal scholarship on judicial misconduct and community harm.&nbsp;\nGreg is an inspiration to me and countless people who have crossed paths with him. In the past 39 years, he has taken every opportunity to improve himself and help others. He has served as a peer counselor, legal research instructor, and led numerous workshops on aggression replacement training and domestic violence prevention. He\u2019s also completed college-level courses that transformed his world view and fueled his aspirations for the future.\nEvery day I worry for my uncle.&nbsp;Uncle Greg isn\u2019t eligible for parole for another 11 years. His innocence is known by his family, his supporters and his legal team. It will be proven in a court of law one day. But until that day comes, nothing is more important than this: Greg Mingo needs to come home.\nInspired by my uncle\u2019s story, CUNY law students are assisting Greg with filing a clemency application, calling on Governor Cuomo to show compassion for Greg and release him from prison.&nbsp;\nHow You Can Help\nGreg Mingo\u2019s family and supporters have set up this petition to gather signatures to advocate for his clemency. Please add your name (and address if you live in New York) to call for his release. For more info on how to get involved, please email info@freegregmingo.com or go to freegregmingo.com.\n* Please note: Including your address with your name\u2014especially authentic New York State addresses\u2014is a HUGE help.

Cuomo, it will boost Greg\u2019s chances of freedom.\nI sincerely thank you for taking the time to learn about someone who means so much to my family.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/qj/ff/DmQjfFiaIERjnMd-800x450-noPad.jpg?1603145343"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/department-of-justice-demand-doj-charge-insurrectionist-with-murder-of-capitol-police?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Demand DOJ charge insurrectionist with Murder of Capitol Police", "description": "We demand that the people who entered the Capitol building on 1/7/2021 be charged under the felony murder rule, as while insurrectionist were looting and sabotaging the Capitol building a Capitol police officer was killed.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/hl/rc/BkHlrcOGzyULnld-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610136095"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/josh-hawley-and-the-us-senate-josh-hawley-must-resign-or-be-expelled?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Josh Hawley must resign or be expelled", "description": "Josh Hawley is a primary reason for the attempted coup on the United States Capital.

All the subtle spice notes, the crunch and airy texture you can only find with a Lay's Potato Chip, it was truly a match made in heaven.

This event is considered to be an act of domestic terrorism that challenged the ability of our federal government to function properly and threatened our national security.&nbsp;\nAccording to policy code 2220 of the Lee County School Board of Education, public officials are to conduct themselves to higher standards than non-elected officials. They are to remember that their public actions are not just a reflection of themselves but of the board, the school district, and the county. Board member Womack's intentional public sharing of her participation in seditious acts against the federal government does NOT reflect the board, school district, or county in a positive light.&nbsp;\nBy willfully posting evidence of her approval of the Capitol takeover, Womack has aligned herself with acts of terrorism. This is unpatriotic and dangerous as it reflects Lee County's schools and citizens. We, the voters and residents of Lee County believe that Womack should resign immediately and should be replaced by a member who can more effectively represent the interests of Lee County as a diverse community and uphold the sovereignty of the federal government.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/zf/xd/NrZfxDzMEdaCRKd-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610470765"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/donald-j-trump-bring-kash-lee-kelly-home-we-all-need-him?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Bring Kash Lee Kelly home.

She also does not believe in masks in her class and this makes Lassiter look awful and white dominated and racist. She should not keep her job. Mrs. Doemel has had many racist facebook posts. She got fired for them for a semester, then was welcomed back this semester. She recently told an anonymous student she attended the raid at the capital and said it was \u201cVery fun\u201d. She also refuses to wear her mask while teaching as she believes she is \u201cImmune to Covid-19\u201d. She brags about her political opinions and going to rallies. There have also been students that are POCs that have said they feel \u201cuneasy\u201d around her because of her old racist comments and racist facebook remarks. We truly don\u2019t think any student should feel that their teacher is out to get them because of their skincolor. Certain parents and most students do not feel comfortable in the environment Mrs. Doemel has been teaching in.

local community may be unable to prevent development, that will be detrimental to the area, nearly all residents in the&nbsp;surrounding neighborhoods are completely opposed to the addition of multi-family housing that will cause traffic and safety problems, create even more problems with schools that are already over capacity, already over destroyed wildlife habitat, and potentially lower the property values of the existing community.&nbsp;\nThe traffic surge during morning rush hours will negatively impact safety for children since students walk to school in the mornings.&nbsp; In general, the area traffic is continuing to increase, and heavy traffic is already common on Limona Road and Victoria Street during work and school hours.&nbsp; Additionally, there has been two fatal car accidents on the north and south side of the railroad tracks and&nbsp;one student walking in the crosswalk at Meade Street and Victoria Street.\nSchools and daycares in the area are already reported at overcapacity, and the county should not approve multi-family dwelling that creates or exacerbates a situation that will cause school concurrency to fail for this proposal and/ or other approved plans.\nWildlife has been observed in the area and any development will destroy their habitat.&nbsp; Any planned development of the property should consider the continuing impact to local wildlife habitat.&nbsp; Coyotes sightings have become normal circumstance within our neighborhoods at all times of the day and threaten the safety of children and household pets.&nbsp; There have been recorded attacks and sighting at local schools as recently as today, January 12, 2021 at Brandon High School at 1:00 PM.&nbsp;\nProperty values are likely to go down in the area if multi-family apartments or condominiums are built.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multi-family dwellings are inconsistent with the neighborhoods developed in this area.&nbsp;\nI urge you to disapprove the proposed zoning and recent

They were able to receive my Snapchat password, and they locked me out of my account. They had access to all of my \u201cMemories,\u201d a feature Snapchat encourages its users to utilize to store content, and therefore access to personal images, screenshots, and most pictures that I have taken on Snapchat in the past few years. The hacker then sent messages to my friends telling them to tell me to talk to them from a new account.\nThe hacker then continued to threaten me and provide ultimatums. Give them my \u201cMy Eyes Only\u201d password and they would give me my Recovery Code, they would not hack my friends, they would not post images on my Public Story, they would not post my images on a Revenge P*rn website, etc..\nMy \u201cMy Eyes Only\u201d included sensitive, explicit, and most of all personal content, so I did not give them the password. They then proceeded to post semi-nude images of me from my \u201cMemories\u201d on my Public Snapchat Story, and I do not know what they did with any of the other images, whether they are saved to their phone and shared with their friends or posted publicly on the Internet.\nI acknowledge that this is Sexual Harassment and Cyberbullying. In some photos, I am under the age of 18, which borders Child P*rnography.\nI filed out the Snapchat Report form right as they sent me the first threat, asking for access back to my account or for the account to be deleted. Almost 12 hours later, I have received no reply. There is no helpline to call and nothing I can do. I have filed a police report, but that too is to no avail in these complicated and tricky times.\nEvery time I changed the password, they changed it back. They set up a new Two-Factor Authentication and refuse to give me the Recovery Code. They have access to all my personal content, and I feel violated and helpless.\nSUMMARY:\nSnapchat is a growing social media platform catering internationally to people as young as 13. With new features like \u201cMemories\u201d and \u201cMy Eyes Only,\u201d introduced, many users store private and personal information, images, and more under the impression that it is safe.\nAlthough there are new protective features Snapchat has implemented, such as Two-Factor Authentication, accounts still continue to get compromised - thus private information and content is compromised, which can be unsafe, especially for minors. Snapchat does not have any sort of widely-known 24-hour helpline and does not provide a time frame for responding to filed reports through their Support platform.\nIn the case that an account is compromised or hacked into, or in the case of some Emergency, there should exist a way to quickly delete said account.\nThis may present itself as a 24-hour callable helpline, an Emergency report form that will be responded to within a few hours, or something else. This platform should be available remotely and accessible to someone who does not have their phone.\nGOAL:\nI hope to protect future Snapchat users, especially minors who might not know of additional authentication features, by pushing Snapchat to create a way for users to Delete a Compromised Account in case of Emergency or a special scenario like mine. I wish that everyone\u2019s personal content within the application is protected. The same way a credit card can be canceled if it falls into the wrong hands, a Snapchat account should be able to be quickly deleted should it do the same.\nThank you for your time and support!\n**I also think that Recovery Codes and Authentication Features should be more widely publicized.**", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/9/wi/ix/LSwIIxBxRiAAkjB-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610794939"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/united-states-department-of-transportation-reverse-the-dot-ban-on-emotional-support-animals-on-us-flights?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Reverse the DOT Ban on Emotional Support Animals on US Flights!", "description": "Thousands of people have emotional support animals that help them during short and long flights every year.

The canal is very pleasant to walk alongside and I couldn\u2019t imagine it being encased in a pipeline. We all love the canal, despite the few flooding issues. The homeowners have found solutions in the past to defend their properties against flooding damage. These solutions can be expounded upon without use of a pipeline.\nOn top of it being a beautiful part of the scenery, it is also a supplementary water source for birds, ducks, and small critters.The concerns listed in the proposal do not seem valid or urgent to me. As a resident of the area, I have spoke to the homeowners on the canal and they have expressed a desire to maintain the canal as is. In spite of the occasional flooding, we all still love the canal and want to solve problems without the use of a pipe. I have walked alongside the canal during rainstorms when water levels were high and the canal was able to accommodate. Improvements can be made to endure even more water if needed.\nWater conservation is listed as one of the concerns for this project as well. I do not see how a pipeline would be necessary for conservation seeing as how the canal can be managed just perfectly as is. However, I am not opposed to the construction/ improvement of the SCIC diversion structure or the headgate structures.\nFor full project proposal visit http://www.truckeeriver.nvwatershed.com\nPlease share your concerns by emailing truckeeriver@nvwatershed.com, sharing and signing this petition, and telling others in your community!!!

Between the months of April 2019 and December 2019 Sabrina made many pleas for police intervention, filed an Order of Protection and an Intimidation Report, and repeatedly told officers that her life was at risk, yet the Memphis Police Department failed her, as they historically have when dealing with racial-minority women who live in underserved communities experiencing domestic violence. Sabrina took all of the right steps and was promised protection, yet officers continuously showed her a different level of care than they statistically have shown to white women or women with higher socio-economic status who have experienced domestic violence. The choices made by officers here directly led to the death of Sabrina Nguyen.\nSABRINA\u2019S LAST CALLS FOR HELP&nbsp;The Memphis Police Department was first made aware of the violence Sabrina was experiencing in April of 2019 when Sabrina was assaulted while moving out of her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home. In June, Sabrina was once again assaulted by her ex-boyfriend and officers took him into custody while Sabrina went through the process of having an Order of Protection put in place against him, which she was told would prevent any contact between the two. In August, Sabrina was kidnapped and assaulted by her ex-boyfriend. In September, Sabrina\u2019s ex-boyfriend stalked her home and attempted to break in.&nbsp;In December, 911 calls were made by Sabrina on at least 11 separate occasions. Sabrina filed assault charges on December 10th after being kidnapped and assaulted by her ex-boyfriend which led to his arrest on the same day. He bonded out on December 11th and by December 14th, Sabrina was already receiving more haunting phone calls from him. He was arrested again on December 17th and posted bond on December 18th. On December 19th he kidnapped Sabrina and pulled a knife on her.&nbsp;On December 20th he kidnapped Sabrina again and drove her across multiple states until finally dropping her off at the Memphis Police Department on December 23rd. Sabrina made officers aware on the 23rd that her ex-boyfriend had stolen her vehicle and she called MPD repeatedly in the days after the incident to check on the progress they had made in getting her vehicle back. A warrant was finally, after 6 days, issued for the theft of Sabrina\u2019s vehicle, but officers did not make any documented attempt to make an arrest or get Sabrina\u2019s vehicle back between the time of the warrant being issued and Sabrina\u2019s death.&nbsp;On January 1st, 2020 Sabrina\u2019s brother reported Sabrina as a missing person and provided officers with the address of Sabrina\u2019s ex-boyfriend. On January 2nd, 2020 officers found Sabrina\u2019s dead body lying on a sidewalk near a busy intersection. According to an affidavit, \u201c[t]he Scene Officer recognized [the body to be that of] Sabrina Nguyen from multiple incidents involving her ex-boyfriend.\u201d&nbsp;Sabrina\u2019s ex-boyfriend kidnapped and assaulted her on multiple occasions, made terroristic threats towards her, stole her vehicle, violated bail conditions, and stalked her. He was arrested twice and had 8 formal charges brought against him in the month of December alone. Officers knew where he lived and had arrested him at that location previously. Officers knew that Sabrina desperately needed her vehicle in order to work and to get away from dangerous situations. Despite all of this information, officers chose not to act between December 23rd and January 1st and that choice led to their finding of Sabrina\u2019s dead body on January 2nd. Officers were given countless signs that should have led them to make different choices, choices that would have saved Sabrina, yet due to her gender, race and position in society, they made decisions that led to her death instead.&nbsp;WHY WE MUST DEMAND CHANGE&nbsp;Officers across the nation continuously fail to acknowledge diversity when handling situations of domestic violence. Women as a whole are more vulnerable to experiencing domestic violence and women of color are the most likely demographic to experience domestic violence while simultaneously being the most disproportionately affected by homicides resulting from intimate-partner-violence. It is well known that social position and economic status also play a huge part in resources and services made available to individuals and that stands true in situations of domestic violence as well.&nbsp;Even if officers were offering the exact same level of protection to these racial-minority women in underserved communities as they were to their white, well-off counterparts, they would not be taking into consideration the fact that many of these techniques and services would be ineffective to this population of women because of the unique nature of their experiences with domestic violence. Officers must be held accountable in situations like Sabrina\u2019s wherein they choose to ignore the seriousness of the situation and make decisions that lead to deaths that could easily have been prevented.&nbsp;The actions suggested below are some of the changes which we believe would have saved Sabrina Nguyen if implemented by the Memphis Police Department, and if implemented across the United States, will function to protect many more women like Sabrina in the future.&nbsp;1. Notification systems must be put in place which automatically notify domestic violence victims when their arrested aggressor becomes eligible to post bond or is released.&nbsp;2. Police officers must be required to have higher levels of training in preventative and intervening measures which require the consideration of societal factors such as gender, race, and socio-economic status that make violence more likely to occur or more likely to result in death within certain populations.&nbsp;3. Police departments must be required to create and keep an up-to-date database for domestic-abuse related incidents and information which would allow officers and 911-operators to be automatically made aware of any history or patterns of domestic violence when searching someone\u2019s name in the department\u2019s already-existing system.&nbsp;4. Demand transparency of police departments by requiring a yearly public report detailing the funds spent and measures taken to prevent further predictable deaths of women of color in underserved communities who experience domestic violence. This report should also provide yearly statistics of domestic violence in that department\u2019s jurisdiction and the deaths resulting from such instances which can be broken down by race, gender, and socio-economic status.&nbsp;5. Demand that officers have ongoing education and training of the unique realities, difficulties, and needs of racial-minority women in underserved communities experiencing domestic assault.&nbsp;6. Demand the creation of programs that are catered towards racial-minority women in underserved communities which allows them to report domestic violence to non-police officers and provides them with resources and services that allow them to safely get away from their aggressor even if they are fearful of having police involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you or anyone you know is experiencing domestic violence, please reach out for help. The National Domestic Violence Hotline can be called 24 hours a day at 1(800) 799-7233 and their website, thehotline.org, provides contact information for local resources in all 50 states.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/xt/oi/omxtoIPqZJqRMnZ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609779759"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/tennessee-general-assembly-save-persons-with-intellectual-disabilities-from-execution-in-tennessee?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Save Persons with Intellectual Disabilities from Execution in Tennessee.", "description": "Both the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 and the Tennessee Supreme Court in 2001 have ruled that a person with an intellectual disability should not be executed.

She was a dynamic leader rising in power from becoming Mississippi\u2019s former Director of Human and Cultural Needs and a member of the Canton Municipal School Board.\nMs. Rainey was indicted on charges for a voter fraud conspiracy based on the false police report of a witness who claimed that Courtney paid her to vote. Courtney confronted Ousley, a woman she had known most of her life, and asked her to go back and tell the truth. During Courtney\u2019s trial, the witness admitted to lying about Courtney paying for her vote. She testified that she lied because she was afraid of the police. &nbsp;She also said that she was never intimidated by Courtney.\nHowever, according to the state, Ms. Rainey's actions still constituted intimidation, even if the witness admitted to lying and testified that she was never intimidated by Courtney. For this reason, Although she was not convicted for the voter fraud charge, she was convicted for witness intimidation. She was sentenced to 15 years, the maximum sentence for witness intimidation.\nCourtney Rainey\u2019s story is another painful example of the ills of this criminal legal system.

The historic American Can Company buildings (now called American Tin Cannery, or ATC) located at the entrance to Pacific Grove, California would be largely demolished and all 79 healthy, mature, trees would be removed including 52 supposedly protected Monterey Cypress trees.&nbsp; The project proposes 347,376 square feet of three-story and four-story buildings, with 2 separate hotel structures, entrances and lobbies, 2 swimming pools, retail space, and 260 underground valet parking spaces excavated out of solid granite, plus 44 street-level valet spaces off Central Ave.\nWHY SHOULD YOU CARE?\nHarbor Seals pups threatened.&nbsp; Our community takes pride in the fact the beaches across the street from the proposed American Tin Cannery Hotel have provided safe space for Harbor Seals to haul out and to raise pups.&nbsp; Noise pollution and underground drilling &amp; excavation vibrations are expected to significantly stress the Harbor Seals, which are known to be very sensitive to even normal construction noise.&nbsp; The granite is so hard and dense that conventional excavation methods cannot be used.&nbsp; Construction is estimated to last two years, with demolition of the reinforced concrete buildings and excavation of granite bedrock lasting an estimated 2 and 1/2 months, including removal of over 6,500 truckloads of granite, building debris, and pavement.&nbsp; Serious impacts on the seals have NOT been adequately addressed by the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR).\nExtreme tree removal.&nbsp; The proposed ATC hotel project is so massive that it requires the removal of 79 trees (including \u201cprotected\u201d Monterey Cypresses), which comprise the entire tree population of the property.&nbsp;

Armenians are struggling to live and defend their independent democratic Republic of NK/Artsakh. This right to self-determination was granted to all autonomous regions belonging to the former Soviet Union after the USSR collapsed; however, the Republic of NK / Artsakh continues to be denied the same liberty.&nbsp;\nWe demand to\n1) &nbsp;RECOGNIZE the democratic indigenous Armenian state, Republic of NK/Artsakh.2) &nbsp;STOP the Azeri and Turkish dictatorship.&nbsp;3) &nbsp;HOLD Azerbaijan and Turkey accountable for committing genocides &amp; other crimes against humanity that violate the established UN\u2019s Declaration of Human Rights\nI. We call on&nbsp;the Geneva Convention&nbsp;to hold the government of Azerbaijan responsible for committing acts of genocide and other violations against Armenian soldiers and civilians in NK/ Artsakh and levy strict economic sanctions on Azerbaijan for:\n1) The use of Cluster bombs on Armenian citizens and war zones.\nOn September 27, 2020, the Azeri army broke the Peace Agreement of 1994 between the two nations, Azerbaijan, and the Republic of NK/Artsakh. The Azerbaijani government used banned cluster bombs to attack residential areas in NK inhibited by native Armenians at 7 am. The use of cluster bombs violates the Geneva Conventions, also known as The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) of 2008 prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of cluster munitions in war zones, particularly in regions largely occupied by civilians.\n2) The use of white phosphorous munitions containing chemical weapons in the war zone &amp; the region.\nOn Oct 30, 2020, Azeri military forces engaged in the use of white phosphorus munitions, in the region of NK/Artsakh. The use of chemical weapons grossly violates the following laws: the International Humanitarian Law, principles of Customary Law, Geneva Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention, Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Technique, and the provisions of the relevant UN conventions and documents.\n3) The Azerbaijani government\u2019s unprecedented treatment of prisoners during the recent war in NK/Artsakh which by far exceeds the level of cruelty that the Nazis practiced during the WWII crimes. It is further noted that this treatment continues to persist despite the signing of a treaty agreement.&nbsp;\nII. We call on the&nbsp;UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the UN Council to&nbsp;recognize the independent Republic of NK/Artsakh&nbsp;and&nbsp;to hold the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments accountable for the systematic violations of human rights. We also call for both governments to be held accountable for the ongoing extermination of Armenians and their culture, which occurred during Azerbaijan\u2019s recent violation of the 1994 Peace Agreement in tandem with the overt support of Turkey on September 27, 2020.\nIn accordance with UN Convention, the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that states:\n\u201c\u2026Article I\nThe Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.\nArticle II\nIn the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\n(a) Killing members of the group;\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.&nbsp;\nArticle III\nThe following acts shall be punishable:\n(a) Genocide;\n(b) Conspiracy to commit genocide;\n(c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide;\n(d) Attempt to commit genocide;&nbsp;\n(e) Complicity in genocide;\nArticle IV\nPersons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals\u2026\u201d\n1) WE demand to recognize sovereignty and independence of the Republic of NK/Artsakh and STOP the Azerbaijani and Turkish government\u2019s dictatorship in this region.\nThe recognition of the Republic of NK/Artsakh\u2019s sovereignty is the only way to build peace and to stop the genocide occurring in this region. The formal recognition of this region will save many generations from experiencing collective pain and intergenerational trauma. The systemic extermination of the Armenians and Armenian culture, in addition to the false representation of historical facts, violates the integrity of the region and creates trauma that will be passed on to 14 generations.&nbsp;\nWe must prevent the current and future generations from experiencing further trauma.&nbsp;\nThe Republic of NK/Artsakh has been governed by democratic principles for several decades since its independence from the Soviet regime.&nbsp;\nThe Azerbaijani and Turkish governments engage in acts that violate the human rights of their own citizens, thus openly violating the UN Declaration of Human Rights.&nbsp;\n2) To hold the Azerbaijani government responsible for committing genocidal acts against Native Armenians, other crimes against humanity, and obstructing justice by manipulating and practicing revisionism &amp; denialism!\nArmenians in NK/ Artsakh experienced systematic oppression and violation of fundamental human rights due to Azeri oppression. The marginalization and sub-humanization of Armenian people in NK/ Artsakh region is a norm in Azeri culture. The Azerbaijani government justifies, manipulates, blames, and perpetuates the horrors of genocide by committing murder, and organizing pogroms.&nbsp;The recent war in NK/Artsakh is essentially the next step in the Azerbaijani plan to erase the Armenian nation and its culture from the region.&nbsp;\nFor decades, including the years during the Soviet Union, the Azerbaijani government periodically committed acts of genocide and cultural cleansing of Armenians in NK/ Artsakh. For example, the Nakhichevan region was inhabited by Armenians for thousands of years and yet every Armenian family was forced to flee to save their lives. At present day, there are no Armenians living in this region. Later, was the Sumgait genocide of Armenians in 1988, followed by the genocide of Armenians in Kirovabad (Ganja). Thereafter, there were Armenian pogroms in Baku in the 90s, followed by the Karabakh war of 1994, and the current violation of the peace agreement that the Azerbaijani government signed with the government of Republic NK/Artsakh in 1994. On September 27, 2020, the Azerbaijani military used banned cluster bombs on peacefully sleeping Armenian civilians. They also used white phosphorous chemical weapons in the war zone and forests where people found refuge from the bombing. In addition, Azerbaijan engaged in the deliberate destructions of infrastructures, including hospitals, schools, churches and historical Armenian heritage buildings / monuments in the region both during and after the war. These are a short list of examples of the brutalities inflicted on the Armenian people and their culture in NK/ Artsakh.\nDenialism is the primary technique that the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments use to justify and conceal their crimes against humanity.&nbsp;The promotion of hate speech and Armenophobia in multimedia and press is very common in both countries. Moreover, the economic and political suppression and isolation of Armenians in the region has forced thousands of Armenians to flee from their homeland. These acts are strategically practiced by both governments in order to manipulate and falsify cultural and historical facts in the region, including but not limited to the destruction of Armenian ancient heritage. For example, the largest ancient Armenian cemetery in the world, Julfa, that was protected by UNESCO has been destroyed by Azeris. They also have rewritten the ancient scripts and altered ancient maps of the region. They created false accusations and fabricated stories about Armenian occupation of the land with fake documents and manufactured sources. These are a short list of examples reflecting acts of cultural genocide committed by the Azerbaijani and Turkish governments to actively pursue the annihilation of the Armenian people and their history in NK/ Artsakh that dates back 2600 years. The Azerbaijani and Turkish government\u2019s attempts to fabricate a new history of the NK/ Artsakh region and annihilation of the Armenian culture is an insult on the world\u2019s conscience. A recent exhibit of the Armenian heritage organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC, displayed multiple ancient artifacts and historical facts of the rightful existence of indigenous Armenian civilization in the Caucus region including the NK/Artsakh region for thousands of years.&nbsp;\nThe Azerbaijani government with open support of the Turkish government, continues to commit unprecedented levels of violations against humanity by systematically exterminating the indigenous Armenian people and their culture. They falsely claim NK/ Artsakh land, heritage, and history as their own!&nbsp;\nWE the undersigned in this petition demand the UN recognize the Azerbaijani\u2019s genocide of Armenians in NK/Artsakh that has lasted for decades!&nbsp; We must STOP the BARBARIAN PRACTICES in 21st&nbsp; century and STAND UP for humanity!\nWe choose to follow the three pillars of the American Founding Fathers JUSTICE, PEACE, and DEMOCRACY.\nWithout Justice, it is impossible to establish Peace and without Peace, Democracy cannot be nourished.

But I write to you today with passion and fear that we as HUMANS are failing our fellow man. First of all, I don\u2019t defend the actions of criminals-never have, never will. If we are truly to support and uphold the tenet of \u201cLiberty and Justice for All\u201d then we have to do better.\nIF the justice system is designed to exonerate the innocent and punish the guilty:\nWhy would we lock up men who served their time in full?Why would we lock up men for what they MIGHT do in the future?Why would we lock up men with no definitive release date?Why would we target one offense to lock up potential future crimes?Why would we make men pay for and wear ankle bracelets in a locked facility?Why would we charge men 33% of all income and gifts (on top of paid taxes)?Why would we increase a multi-million dollar budget by 63% in just a few years and see no increase in the quality of care or release through rehabilitation?Why would we call a prison a center for treatment (locked doors, razor wire, ankle monitors, etc.)?Why would we only let them outside an hour a day if they are \u201cresidents\u201d of treatment?Why would we only release a handful in half a decade?Why would we let a business profit from incarceration?Why would we let a business profit for NOT releasing \u201cresidents\u201d?Why would we allow ONE person to decide if someone needed treatment? Even parole has a board of people to review release.Why would we move from outpatient care of productive working citizens that had served their time and were attending regular therapy for treatment to an inpatient facility (prison with another name) with no clear path for release in a FOR PROFIT shadow prison?In Littlefield, Texas there is a FOR PROFIT prison holding men that served their time, or residents as the state would say, for crimes they MIGHT commit after they have served their full sentence. Justice, you say. I say business for mass incarceration. I say a failed idea when treatment is so inconsistent because of staff turnover and the deliberate reluctance to release because a company can\u2019t make money off empty beds.\nWe should be ashamed. People should know.\nReframe your thinking. You get two speeding tickets. Now the state has decided that you will speed again. It is just a matter of time. The state revokes your license, makes you wear and pay for a monitor, and you have to keep paying the fine every month. You attend defensive driving, at your own expense, weekly, but you can\u2019t pass the class. The instructor changes weekly and doesn\u2019t know how well you did in the prior weekends. You cry \u201cwolf\u201d, but no one listens. Your just a poor guy in a little known, small Texas town. You can\u2019t afford good counsel, but you know it\u2019s wrong. Why would we do this to you? To anyone? You paid your fine, you attended the class, your insurance went up, but you might, you just might do it all again.\nI don\u2019t care who you are. Justice is justice. If you punish me for something I did and I take that punishment, then justice was served. If the legal system is designed to correct wrongs, why would we punish indefinitely? How can we punish indefinitely? Where\u2019s the justice? Where is the chance for redemption? You tell me. You tell me.\nThe Texas Civil Commitment Center is a FOR-PROFIT SHADOW PRISON that makes money off mass incarceration with no clear path for release. We should all be worried about freedom. We should all be concerned about men that have served sentences that were handed down by their peers and a judge. When did we become a government that throws the very tenets of the law out the window to make money? This place needs to be investigated and wrongs need to be righted.

We are deeply concerned that our children have been learning remotely for far too long. Many of our children have been 100% remote since March 2020, with a proposed return to school in late January 2021. However the history of this situation does not give us hope that a return to in-person learning will occur. While more than half of NJ school districts opened in September, some districts have remained closed since March and the promise of reopening has been repeatedly postponed.\nInitially, a state mandate guaranteed that all NJ children would have the opportunity for in-person learning during the 2020-2021 school year. That mandate was modified in August to allow districts to begin school remotely with an explanation, a plan, and a proposed reopening date. Many districts declared that they would go fully remote the very next day or soon after the mandate was issued. These districts have since proposed multiple reopening dates, only to pull those plans at the last minute and defer the date again and again. The latest promise of a January opening does not give us confidence that our children will return to school. We need more than promises. We need another mandate.\nAlthough many of our districts have completed the safety upgrades they said were required to transition to in-person learning, they have nonetheless delayed reopening due to high transmission rates of the virus. Governor Murphy, you yourself released a statement along with six other governors in which you said \u201cin person learning is safe when the appropriate protections are in place, even in communities with high transmission rates.\u201d During your news conferences, you have repeatedly said that school outbreaks have remained low and that you don\u2019t see a need to order schools to close. But that is in fact what is happening in our districts. We believe that if the reason for closure is due to high transmission rates, that decision should be across the board and consistent for all schools, not based on individual district preferences which leave some children going to school while others continue to struggle with no end in sight. We also believe that given that in person school provides an \u201cessential service\u201d, schools should be the last to close after non-essential businesses have closed.\nIndoor dining is open. Gyms, hair salons, and nail salons are open. Retail is open. So many non-essential businesses are open, yet providing the essential public good of in-person education to all of NJ\u2019s children remains optional. Hundreds of NJ school districts are open, and it has been a ray of light for those families to see their children learning, socializing, and feeling some sense of normalcy. Yet those of us who live in districts that stayed 100% remote are still waiting and hoping for that day to come. Our children have been home without an in-person education for over 10 months with no end in sight. The inequity of the situation is appalling and these children are suffering emotionally, intellectually, and physically as a result.\nSchools provide more than academics, they provide social and emotional learning, exercise, and for many children, access to healthy meals as well as a safe place to be while parents are working. Many families do not have the financial ability to hire a caregiver and are forced to choose between going to work and providing adequate care and support for their children. This only serves to further the social and economic division between privileged children and children from lower income families. For many families, private school, a pod, or an in-home caregiver is simply not an option.\nScience and health data collected throughout the pandemic show that schools, particularly elementary schools, are not driving the transmission of COVID-19. Transmission rates in schools are relatively low, especially when compared to other permitted activities such as indoor dining and small gatherings. The CDC, pediatricians, and mental health professionals are in agreement that it is essential to get the children back into classrooms. Remote learning is not an adequate or acceptable substitute for in-person learning. Children are disengaged, isolated, and depressed. Special needs students, students from low income families, and our youngest learners are being hit especially hard, and there is no way to discern how long it will take to reverse the damage.\nPlease help our children by giving them back the right to the public, in-person education that they deserve. We implore Governor Phil Murphy to re-issue the statewide mandate to provide in-person learning options for all school districts in NJ.\nNJ Families for In-Person Learning (NJFIL)\n&nbsp;\nPlease see below for links to some relevant articles supporting the points made in this petition:\nhttps://globalepidemics.org/2020/12/18/schools-and-the-path-to-zero-strategies-for-pandemic-resilience-in-the-face-of-high-community-spread/\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/covid-having-devastating-impact-children-vaccine-won-t-fix-everything-n1251172\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/20/health-202-evidence-doesnt-support-closing-schools-stop-coronavirus/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/world/unicef-warns-of-a-lost-generation-and-finds-school-closures-are-ineffective.html?auth=login-google\nhttps://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/01/05/covid-school-safety-010521\nhttps://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/01/three-studies-highlight-low-covid-risk-person-school", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/gv/kb/zVgVkBkKmIohbuC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609344407"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/louisiana-state-senate-free-henry-montgomery?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "FREE HENRY MONTGOMERY", "description": "&nbsp;Henry Montgomery has been in jail for 55 years as of April 2019, for killing a police officer in 1963 when he was 17 years old.

Persons convicted of Measure 11 offenses receive no parole or reduction of sentence for good behavior while in prison. Giving these people no hope or desire to create change within themselves. No chance for rehabilitation opportunities. People should be able to&nbsp;prove their positive change. Research indicates that incentives can motivate people to complete programs while incarcerated, which in return can lead to better offender outcomes while reducing overall corrections costs. It can also&nbsp;produce positive benefits for key stakeholders by states reducing the costs of building and operating prisons; agencies receive funding to fortify their community supervision programs; and public safety improves through reductions in recidivism, crime, and revocation rates.\nThis Measure altered courtroom dynamics significantly so sentencing decisions would fall on the prosecutor, an advocate for the state, when traditionally that responsibility has been left to the judge, a neutral arbiter of justice. Shifting authority from the judge to the prosecutor and giving the state unjust leverage over an individual exercising their right to a fair trial.\nTDNFTC (Time Does Not Fit The Crime) committee team has been working really hard to advocate for equal rights within the correctional system. Measure 11 convictions are the only convictions who are not elegible to reduce their sentence for good behavior. Our committee drafted a Bill which has been approved and assigned a Bill number through the legislative process. SB 191&nbsp;is requesting&nbsp;equal rights for Adults in Custody with Measure 11 convictions to have the same equal opportunities as others in custody, to earn good time for good behavior.&nbsp;Everyone deserves the same opportunities!

We know and are aware every one has to pay the consequences of their behavior, which is \u201cwhy\u201d good behavior should be acknowledged as well.

This hands-on approach provides students with an interactive experience that helps prepare them for job or intern possibilities. Removing the farm animals (or any other animals) would have adverse effects on the value of the program. The lack of farm animals would take away the experience that students would need to prepare them for going into college. It could also lower the interest of incoming students in the course, which would result in fewer people to care for the animals.\nThere are also risks to transporting the animals out of Arlington Tech. The animals may get stressed and anxious from the loud sounds and movement. It is also important that each animal is provided with proper food, water, and temperature that they need to have during travel. There is a possibility that the vehicles used to move them may not supply each and every animal with its necessities. In addition, these animals have spent many years living at Arlington Tech. They will become upset leaving the place and the people that have cared for them.&nbsp;\nFinally, many students are drawn to this program due to the opportunity to work with animals on a daily basis. Learning how to provide and properly care for them will benefit us in the future. These animals can encourage us to pursue our dreams of becoming groomers, veterinarians, zookeepers, kennel attendants, pet sitters, dog walkers, laboratory animal caretakers, veterinary technicians, wildlife biologists, and many more.

Metro West CD will be able to secure more than $7 million in federal and state tax dollars to complete the development.\nThe City will maintain control of the building by having a deed restriction on the property.&nbsp; This allows the City to set the parameters for the affordable housing use and provides the City with an important oversight role.&nbsp; As with all affordable housing in Waltham, the management for the Armory apartments would be required to report annually to the City\u2019s Housing Division to account for the income verification of the current tenants, rent rates, and a copy of all leases to ensure compliance with the affordable housing deed restriction.\nThe historical building will be preserved.&nbsp;The Armory is registered under the National Historic Registry, any changes made to the building will have to be approved by the State Historic Commission.What changes will be made to the appearance of the Armory?Minor changes are proposed such as the addition of dormers on the 3rd floor.&nbsp; This would be needed in order to fit the 23 units in the building.&nbsp; Affordable housing projects need to be over 20 units in order to be eligible for state and federal funding otherwise they would not be financially feasible.\nThere is support from Mayor McCarthy, the Waltham Community Preservation Committee, the Waltham Historic Commission, and WATCH CDC.\nMore Info at https://watchcdc.org/community-organizing-d1/armory/", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/md/vk/vlMDVKLVyKhynOA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608774317"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/members-of-congress-we-lock-down-all-the-time-in-school-enact-sensible-gun-reform-now?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Demand that Congress enact sensible gun reform!", "description": "The world watched in horror as the U.S. Capitol building, one of our cherished beacons of democracy, was raided by insurrectionists.The world saw your fear as you cowered, not knowing exactly who to fear or what they would do. Nobody blamed you. You had our empathy and we feared right along with you.But perhaps no one could empathize more sincerely than our nation's cadre of teachers and K-12 students. We regularly run through lockdown drills where we are forced to imagine some unknown assailant or assailants are stalking our halls, hoping that someone will make a noise to give away their location. We huddle with our students in silence. Our minds race about if we'll ever have to do this for real. And for tens of thousands of our students, they actually have. The Washington Post estimates that over 240,000 students have had first-hand experience with gun violence in their schools.&nbsp;But schools represent only a small part of the gun violence our children must suffer through. It is estimated by the American Public Health Association that between 1999 and 2017, nearly 39,000 children were killed by gun violence in this country. That's enough kids to fill nearly every seat in Citi Field in Queens, NY, where the New York Mets play.The shutdowns due to COVID have given our schoolchildren a small reprieve from that continual threat of violence. Hopefully schools can be fully open to welcome students back soon, but what level of safety will we be offering if nothing about the status of guns in our country has changed?\nWe are at a crossroads in our country, and while we have so many other problems to reconcile at this moment in history, we cannot reopen our country to all the same problems we've been able to forget over the last year of pandemic inertia.Members of Congress - we beg you: remember your fear, and your uncertainty, and the anger you experienced on January 6, 2021.

In observing this process I noticed several flaws in the way we go about these cases. Unfortunately, removing this statute would do nothing for this case specifically, so I will not be further elaborating on most of those flaws. However, I can focus on one major flaw and use my experience from this case to make a change for a better process for future victims. When this man was arrested, there were 7 cases against him. Thanks to the statute of limitations and its application to this case, there are now 2.\nAccording to the 4th edition of Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, the purpose and effect of statutes of limitations are to protect defendants and there are three reasons for their enactment:&nbsp;\n1. A plaintiff with a valid cause of action should pursue it with reasonable diligence.\nIn a case regarding developing minds, due diligence should not be necessary. These people need time to adjust to their reality.\n&nbsp;2. By the time a stale claim is litigated, a defendant might have lost evidence necessary to dispute the claim.&nbsp;\nIn most cases, this gives the defendant plenty of extra time to acquire and dispose of concrete evidence. I saw this firsthand with the defendant in said case, as he pulled out all of his laptops in a panic and wiped them clean after getting word of the investigation. The victims however still have no choice but to live with the evidence engrained in their memories.\n3. Litigation of a long dormant claim may result in more cruelty than justice.\nLitigation of a long dormant claim in the case of child abuse is necessary. By exercising this statute in these cases; we\u2019re throwing out multiple opportunities for justice and allowing far more room for cruelty on the victims end. &nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A statute of limitations sets in place an allotment of time in which a plaintiff can file a claim, in the state of Idaho a statute of limitations is amended to section 6-1701 as a tort action to defendants regarding child abuse and child sexual abuse cases. This statute of limitations gives the victim of a crime 5 years to come forward once they\u2019ve turned 18. The second they reach adulthood the clock is ticking for them to make sense of their situation, tell somebody, and muster the courage to take legal action. At that point it still can take months for someone to get their case off the ground, leaving them nothing to do when that time does pass. For a child going through abuse, especially from an adult perpetrator, that\u2019s the only reality they know. Children are especially resilient and will adapt to this lifestyle as normal. It\u2019s not until they become adults that they\u2019re allowed to make decisions for themselves, learn how their peers grew up and start to mark the differences. They have to completely dismantle the truth of life they made for themselves in order to survive, and start anew. These children have already lost years of their lives due to the fact that they were focused on survival, and with this statute in place we\u2019re taking away their first chance for justice so they can focus on thriving.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For these reasons I do not see due diligence as necessary as delayed reporting is not only normal but should be expected. There are other states in the US (7, to be specific) that have recognized this and removed the statute as pertaining to rape cases. This statute of limitations clearly does not apply to these type of crimes and therefore should be removed. By signing this petition you are declaring you\u2019d like to see change. Use your voice, speak up for the unheard, the silenced, and those who were denied justice.

Although UNICEF Adverts always states that \u201cqualified women are encouraged to apply,\u201d and while UNICEF's official report based on an independent investigation of Workplace Gender Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, Harassment and Abuse of Authority (commissioned by UNICEF Executive Director, Dr. Fore) found widespread evidence of abuse and harassment of whistleblowers, the organization has continued to fail to respond appropriately to the numerous reports of workplace harassment and extreme intimidation.\nPage 6 of the ITF report notes that \u201cthis \u2018results at any cost\u2019 approach has created an environment where offenses go un-reported or un-investigated and unpunished by the set rules, as long as programmatic results are achieved; and has enabled gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, harassment and abuse of authority, which thrive in such conditions\u201d which is to the greater detriment of female staff.\nPage 14 of the ITF report notes that \u201cStaff in focus groups and interviews also reported that gender-related discrimination occurs regularly in the workplace\u201d \u2026with data available to the Task team showing that \u201cof the 366 resignations of international professional staff in the last five years, 57 per cent were female.\u201d\nPage 15 of the ITF report notes \u201ca deeply-rooted authoritative management culture in UNICEF and identified a clear and repeating pattern in staff perceptions of this management culture\u201d \u2026the culture at UNICEF \u201chas concealed unacceptable workplace behaviours and allowed abuse of authority, harassment, sexual harassment and discrimination to proliferate in silence\u201d \u2026which led to misconduct being underreported, \u201cbadly investigated and not adequately sanctioned for a long time.\u201d\nThe above findings of the ITF illustrate the experience of Dr. Onabolu who worked with UNICEF at national and international levels for over a decade. Dr. Onabolu, a former staff member of UNICEF has been in an ongoing battle for justice after enduring a series of clearly documented incidents of discrimination, marginalization, dismissive behavior, verbal and even physical displacement, and abuse at her workstation in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Her documented experiences have yet to receive an independent and fair hearing and redress, despite going through all the internal formal and informal processes of UNICEF including a one-on-one meeting with the Executive Director, Dr. Fore.\nDr. Onabolu was a UNICEF WASH (Water Sanitation Hygiene Specialist) from 2006 to 2015 in Nigeria before being promoted and moved to her position in Bangladesh. At her station, she was the only senior black female specialist amongst other specialists and has excelled in that position; earning high scores on annual evaluations, creating important social networks, and having a considerable professional impact in the field.\n&nbsp;Things changed immediately after a new station Chief was posted to the office. Her new Supervisor, a white Irish male began a series of strategies of gaslighting, isolation, and workplace mistreatment designed to ensure her subservience. When she did not cave, he made it clear he did not want Dr. Onabolu on his team; he ridiculed her, reassigned her work after it was completed, refused to meet with her, and immediately wrote a negative evaluation shortly after he assumed his position. This was set aside after HR (Human Resources) determined he had not been in the station long enough to have information for such feedback. Despite her complaints, there wasn\u2019t any form of intervention capable of halting his assaults. With a white and male-dominated supervisor team, Dr. Onabolu and her struggles were silenced at the local level as other staff members were intimidated into silence or support of the gaslighting.&nbsp;\nAfter escalating her grievances to the headquarters, she was reassigned to a new duty station in New York City as a form of redress. She accepted the NYC reassignment with the promise of a one month paid leave, and four months of working from home. However, before she could resume her post, her reassignment to the new position was withdrawn without reason after she received an email from the UNICEF HR lawyer that she would not be resuming in New York and were unsure where she would actually be resuming work.\n&nbsp;There have been requests from women\u2019s rights advocates to address Dr. Onabolu\u2019s concern, however, her case continued to be sidelined and ignored. The continued extreme intimidation eventually resulted in a severe threat to her health. Despite medical reports indicating that the toxic environment was injurious to her health, she was given the ultimatum to either work under the same supervisor or leave the organization. For the sake of her health, she was forced to resign from UNICEF but has continued to fight for justice, accountability, and redress.\n&nbsp;Page 14 of the Abuse of Authority in UN offices of Bangladesh report notes that \u201cSignificant percentages of staff members have experienced SH (Sexual Harassment) and AA (Abuse of Authority) in UN offices in Bangladesh\u201d \u2026with the survey data provided showing that \u201cincidence of AA is considerably higher among female staff members compared to their male counterparts.\u201d\n&nbsp;Page 15 of the Abuse of Authority in UN offices of Bangladesh report notes that \u201cFemale staff members have reported a significantly higher incidence of AA. One-third of them have experienced such abuses, and as revealed during the group discussions, many of them are experiencing high levels of stress due to bullying behavior of the supervisor/higher authority.\u201d\n&nbsp;Not only do these actions contravene the UN\u2019s purported zero tolerance for workplace abuse, but it also goes against UNICEF's previous statements about how they intend to treat their employees who speak out against the wrongs of the organization. Dr. Onabolu\u2019s case is a representation of UNICEF\u2019s failure to address its own extremely problematic, discriminatory, and poor managerial skills as documented in Page 6 of the ITF report. \"Furthermore, dysfunctional support from systems designed to provide checks and balances on exercise of authority, such as the management of human resources, the complaint system and internal communication with staff, have exacerbated the negative consequences of this existing culture.\n&nbsp;We call on UNICEF Executive Director to live up to her claims of \u201cwhat we have to have is the courage to change\u2026 So, courage is what I am asking you all to think about. This means no bullying, no belittling, no malicious gossip. No harassment of any form. No discrimination. Not here, not here anymore,\u201d Fore continued (as reported by Devex in the town hall meeting with UNICEF staff to discuss the report).\nWe the undersigned, are calling for a fully independent and fair investigation, the strongest forms of accountability for all those found complicit in creating a toxic environment in the UNICEF Dhaka office, and appropriate redress.\n&nbsp;Sincerely,\nCarlos Abreu | cabreu@ithaca.edu\nChancelor Wahl | cwahl@ithaca.edu\nJordin Price | jprice@ithaca.edu\nNicole Cokely | ncokely1@ithaca.edu\nSelin Tuter | stuter@ithaca.edu\nTomas Garcia | tgarcia@ithaca.edu\n&nbsp;\nNote: Bolu Onabolu remains committed to the organization\u2019s core values of care, respect, integrity, trust, and accountability though unfortunately, the findings of the ITF report indicate that \u201cdespite good intentions, UNICEF is not living those values when it comes to this most important resource; its staff.\u201d She continues to push forward the mandate of UNICEF to actualize the human rights vision of ensuring access to safe water and adequate sanitation in her home country, Nigeria in her role as Strategic Advisor of WASHMATA Initiatives, an NGO she established after her forced resignation from UNICEF.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;References\n1.

They\u2019re inflicted with diseases, forced to take drugs, made to endure painful operations and experiments while completely conscious, injected with and force fed chemicals to test toxicity, restrained while lesions are cut into their brains and electrodes are implanted in them, blinded, starved, and suffocated. Can you imagine what it would be like to be in their position? There is no such thing as an illegal experiment on animals in the US. Our tax dollars fund these horrible experiments. The NIH itself has said that 95% of experiments found safe and effective in animals fail in human trials because they don\u2019t work or dangerous. For Covid-19, countless animals, including mice and primates have been tested on. Mice don\u2019t contract it naturally so they must be genetically engineered to get it. Neither develop severe symptoms. This is a waste of lives, money, and time. COVID-19 has left us with a golden opportunity to reimagine the way we approach science. The Animal Welfare Act is the only US federal law that sets standards for feeding, housing, handling, and veterinary care- but allows experimenters to restrain, burn, shock, poison, isolate, starve, mutilate and inflict brain damage on animals. Painkillers are not required. Not only is this evil and inexcusable, but if there were a tornado, the facility could be ripped apart, exposing residents of the area to toxins and diseases.

After my surgery, I was told by every OB/GYN I went to for help that my loss couldn\u2019t have been caused by my surgery and was all in my head.&nbsp;\n16 years later, not one top 20 OB/GYN program will agree to teach this anatomy, despite being entreated to do so by me and my plastic surgeon father.&nbsp;\nThere are many other women with stories like mine, who have lost clitoral function after biopsies, cosmetic surgeries, and repairs (including one after a rape). Preventable damage done during repairs likely goes unrecognized because women assume the original injury caused the damage, rather than their doctor.&nbsp;My loss was so traumatic it felt sometimes worse than death. It is made more painful knowing my injury isn\u2019t considered worth preventing. But it is worth preventing.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/sv/ij/oMsvijfNNBovXJg-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607702237"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/sony-pictures-entertainment-levar-burton-should-be-the-next-host-of-jeopardy?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Make LeVar Burton the next host of Jeopardy!", "description": "Between hosting 21 seasons of the educational Reading Rainbow, playing the brainiac engineer Geordi La Forge on Star Trek: the Next Generation, and filling the roll of Kunta Kinte in the ever important mini-series Roots, LeVar Burton has inspired and shaped the minds of several generations of trivia-loving nerds.

This is not just closing a bar this will cost jobs and will also cost the city Millions to demolish!! They also have no plan at all and are hoping they get a developer... this is from Jeff the bar owner/bar manager:Kim Norton - Mayor of Rochester, MN you are correct this has been in the \u201cworks\u201d for along time. I have leased that space since 2011 from the Labor Union. The city purchased the property in 2013 and continued to carry the lease with Legends. I knew at that time that my business time line was unknown. I agreed to the lease terms knowing that at some point the day would come that a developer would want the property. I was assured that I would be treated fairly and given plenty of notice when plans were brought forth to develop the property. The 90 day notice was put into place by the city after I had asked for a minimum of a 6 month notice reason for 90 day notice was in case a developer could or wanted to move quickly. I agreed to that because like a said I was reassured I would be given plenty of notice. The Bloom company decided they wanted to move ahead with a plan. I was put on notice that things were going to happen the media spread the word several times that Legends would be closing. It was detrimental to my business during those times. People didn\u2019t want to sign up for pool/dart leagues for fear that we would close etc. customer base was also declining because of the reports that we were closing. The Bloom company\u2019s plan never came together so I gained some more time to continue to grow my business and we pushed forward getting back to where we were pre-Bloom. I was told by a couple of council members and city staff that I was good to go and could remain open. Again being reassured that I would be given plenty of notice and especially now with the Bloom project off the table it would take several months to even get anything approved even if someone came in that day with cash and a plan. I was told a 6-9 month minimum timeframe before plans would be approved and underway. Fast forward. I received a letter from city staff saying the city was going to ask council to move ahead with a termination of my lease because of a development plan. Obviously I was devastated to receive this after having my business so drastically affected by the Covid-19 restrictions placed on us. We were closed for 3 months at the start of the pandemic then I chose to close in July for 24 days because of the increase of cases being linked to the downtown businesses then now this last closure lasting two months. I was hopeful that the governor was going to loosen up restrictions and we could work at getting back to trying to recover and move forward in recouping the lost revenue and get our employees back to work. During the first shutdown I took advantage of the time to do some remodeling and fixing things in the building that needed to be done. I spent approximately $10,000 of my own money not any stimulus or government money. In fact I never took any of the PPP money because the city staff worked with me and forgave and reduced some of my rent that I was extremely grateful so I didn\u2019t feel right about taking a handout from the government I wanted that money to go to businesses that needed it more then I did. In return I spent some of the money I would have had to pay for rent and put it back into the building. I have known for several years that this day would come but I feel like I\u2019ve been unfairly targeted. I was found to be in violation of not enforcing the mask mandate and social distancing on Halloween. I take full responsibility for that. I had my business closed by the health dept. for 72 hours I along with my staff worked with the health dept and was given the green light to reopen. Then a few weeks later council voted on offering liquor license holders help with fees and reducing fees for future licenses. Then a council member suggested that a business that was found to be in violation of the governors mandate should not be able to qualify for the help. Two businesses were declined the assistance my business was one of them. I felt like I was being punished again for a previous violation. I had already had my hand slapped by the health dept. Then just as the governor is about to announce a possible reopening of bars and restaurants I received my notice of intent that the city was to terminate my lease. I was lead to believe that a development was underway but only to learn that the property is going to be bulldozed to make way for a \u201cgreen space\u201d until a potential developer comes along. That could take years for someone to want to take the risk especially with the state our country is in with the pandemic etc. My business has been open and prospering for 9 years I have always worked with the city on any issues related to the building or the business practices etc. I encourage you to reach out to the police dept and health dept city staff etc and ask them for yourself. So I ask you are there any programs or funding offered through the city to help me out with relocating my business or am I just suppose to pack my things and get out? You along with city officials pride yourselves and encourage the people of this community during these trying and devastating times to \u201cSupport local small business\u201d by terminating my lease and forcing my business of 9 years to close for some \u201cgreen space\u201d doesn\u2019t really look like you or the city are practicing what you\u2019ve been preaching. For the record my business is not a Casuality of Covid-19 my business is going to be a casualty at the hand of the city of Rochester. If you would like to discuss this with me further please I encourage you to do so. City staff has my number. Good day!!

Approximately 2 million dogs die in puppy mills each year, mother dogs are euthanized when they can not have puppies anymore and many puppies are taken from their mothers too soon and die from disease because of it.

Of course, we believe our fellow winter and spring student-athletes should be afforded the chance to participate in their seasons, but we feel that we also deserve the opportunity to have one.\nAs one of the smallest Division I programs in the country, our school and community feels like a family. We understand that having all teams play at once would be difficult, but families sacrifice for one another. We acknowledge that winter and spring sports will take priority, and are willing to make sacrifices to have a limited season of games, especially since most fall sports last competed in November of 2019!\nIn the article and information that was given to us after the decision had already been made to cancel the competition season, it mentioned that this choice would greatly decrease the number of out-of-state visitors to campus, which would help mitigate the risk of virus exposure. While this may be true, with implementing the correct COVID-19 protocols, it should not matter how many players are traveling out-of-state for competitions. It has been proven that if the right policies are in place, a successful season for all teams is possible. We would like that opportunity and are willing to do whatever we can to play this season, whether that involves wearing masks during competitions or being careful outside of our sports and academics.\nAt this time, we are the only school, that we are aware of, in the NEC to opt out of the spring season for fall sports. We want to compete for Saint Francis University this season, and have been working diligently to do so, which is why we are frustrated and disappointed to be completely blindsided by this decision. We do not understand how this choice could have been made without clearly communicating to those that it directly impacts.

At the very least, that is the feeling of many parents due to the lack of transparency from the district.\nTime and time again, for almost a year surveys have been sent to parents, BOE meetings held and data regurgitated as to why the schools have only been open to the first level of 33% without moving past that or why they can\u2019t be reopened. The students want, need and deserve more!\nGive the parents information on what plans the task force team, BOE and superintendent have thought of, created or tried to initiate. Have you broken down #\u2019s of the positive cases, &nbsp;which the decision to keep the school shuttered is being made from? Do they consist mainly of the elderly being Old Bridge has one of the highest amount of assisted living residents within neighboring towns? If we were given this information, even if the plans failed, at minimum we would then know action is being taken other than looking at statistics only. &nbsp;The multiple surveys sent to parents the past (9) months give us hope that our opinions on what in person, hybrid or remote plans work best to meet the needs of our children have value in the decision making process. However, that has proven to not be the case at all! We are demanding a plan of action that is beneficial to the students of Old Bridge and not a temporary band aid.&nbsp;\nThe children, your students, are regressing educationally and emotionally to an extent that the effects are not yet known. That concern should be at the forefront of the districts mind! That is a more realistic concern than the fear of litigation being brought forth on the district for reopening schools. Again have all options been considered; Perhaps a waiver can be signed in terms of attending school to avoid litigation? Can the approved $153m district budget for 20/21 school year now be used to help our students directly with tutors, better devices, readily available books, etc? &nbsp;The funds allocated for new buses, transportation, maintenance, upgrades, etc seem to be null and void with school shuttered for almost a year.\nIf the concern is not enough teachers to teach the students, that of course is valid. Understandably teachers may not all be able to go back to in person learning &amp; have approved 504\u2019s, why can\u2019t those teachers continue to work remotely with the students who have opted out? Do the students who have chosen to opt out and stay remote correlate to the teachers who have 504\u2019s? Why not combine classes within grades..that will free up 1-2 teachers per grade to help cover those that have been approved as high risk with 504\u2019s. Maybe combine the Middle schools into (1) building for the remainder of the year? Of course we don\u2019t have full insight into the logistics so can\u2019t speak on if these options are even viable but those who do have insight, like the superintendent, the task force &amp; the BOE, should provide that information. Again, we want transparency!\nThe fact private schools within our own township, neighboring towns, our neighboring states with much larger student populations are able to go to school in person full time, 5 days a week with lunch being provided, physical education and recess given without being shut down speaks volumes.

When law enforcement was called and responded Don approached the deputy while holding a Semi-automatic handgun in his hands and proceed to point the weapon at the officer. He failed to drop his weapon and show his hands after multiple commands. He was finally arrested after back-up arrived and charged with multiple felonies, including assault on a law enforcement officer, unlawful use of a weapon while intoxicated, and armed criminal action. At that time Don\u2019s family called in favors to long-time Williams family friend Judge Franklin and charges were reduced to a misdemeanor of disturbing the peace.\nOn February 25th, 2020 Don filed to run for a second term. On that date he declared under penalties of perjury that he was not aware of delinquency of taxes; that was a lie. In reality, he owned 3 years\u2019 worth of real estate taxes on his home and 2 years\u2019 worth of personal property taxes. According to 115.306 Rsmo this makes him ineligible to hold office. Don appeared on KRMS trying to blame this blunder on a trust, but that trust dissolved in 2017 and at that time he took possession of the property. That is the same year that he quit paying taxes. He claimed he did not know he owed personal property taxes.\nOn May 28, 2020, Don accepted a campaign contribution from Mr. Larry Coleman in the amount of $3,000. Four days after that donation was received a letter was nailed to a tree in front of Mr. Coleman\u2019s property stating \u201c2nd Commissioner, Don Williams, has brought to my attention the issue of the existing roadway into your fields. Don has explained to me that this road has been used to access those fields for decades,\u201d The county then provided nearly one mile of gravel across private property leading to Mr. Coleman\u2019s property using OUR TAX DOLLARS to do so. Private roads are supposed to be maintained by the landowner and not the county. Don said during candidate debates that the county will be proposing a tax increase this year for road and bridge because it is underfunded. Don\u2019s opponent, Patrick Cochran testifies that Larry Coleman approached him and offered money to his campaign if he would agree to provide this road for him if elected. Patrick declined.\nDon also had the county road (McCubbins Point Rd) resurfaced approximately one mile servicing his family farm that holds his private residence, his sister\u2019s home, and stopping at his brother Nathan Willams\u2019 property, leaving the rest of the road unfinished. He has built structures on this same property and was able to slide by without proper permits acquired by the Osage Beach Fire Protection District who was aware of the construction.\nThis past week 1st District Commissioner James Gohagan was barred from his personal office and prevented from leaving the commission office building, physically threatened and verbally assaulted by a group of county maintenance employees while Commissioner Greg Hasty, Don Williams, and county attorney Charlie McElyea sat by. An audio recording of the incident reveals that Williams and Hasty participated in the event and enticed the situation. They went as far as telling the harassing employees that they loved them. It is alleged that one of these men had a gun in his pocket. These employees are still employed with the county by our tax dollars.\nDon Williams has proven that he has a long history of intimidating behavior and dishonesty. These occurrences not only bring his integrity into question but also his ability of judgment.

We have lived and breathed their fear, disappointment, anxiety, and depression during this extremely unique and life altering year. The kids are not all right. They will certainly be working through the effects of the last ten months for years to come. This is why we want to express our gratitude and support for the Chicago Public School plan to gradually return to in-person learning. We have watched communities and schools around the country successfully return, and we have faith in the public health guidance and CPS plan to bring our kids back to school and get our communities functioning again. What is truly sad, although not surprising, is the fear based campaign that the leadership of the Chicago Teachers Union has been spearheading since the summer. We have learned over the past year that the leadership of the CTU has no interest in advocating for the city\u2019s children, yet it is no less disturbing that CTU leadership seems determined to undermine literally any effort put forth by CPS to return to in-person learning, regardless of how well thought out and researched it is. We would like to voice our support for CPS leadership and thank all of the school administrators who are working tirelessly to bring the children back to school safely.\nDuring uncertain times, important decisions need to be made on facts rather than emotions. CPS put together a thoughtful plan, relying on the CDC\u2019s guidance, our local public health officials and our local medical community. There is no evidence to suggest that a gradual return to in-person learning for CPS students will be any different than other cities and school districts who have successfully reintegrated back into school buildings. One Yale study, including 57,000 child care providers across the United States found, \u201c...as long as there are strong on-site measures to prevent infection, providing care for young children doesn\u2019t seem to add to the provider\u2019s risk of getting sick.\u201d This has been further confirmed by many members of the medical community and expert sources, including the World Health Organization. Our public health experts have now had time to study other school success stories and ensure that CPS is well situated to manage an in-person learning experience safely, and make any required adjustments accordingly. CTU does not seem able to back their list of requests up with public health data or science to support their claims that a return to the classroom will result in more community spread.\nAnyone who leaves their house takes a risk when it comes to the spread of COVID-19. However, many schools in other states and major cities, suburban school districts, private and parochial schools have been in session since the fall (day care centers since the summer), yet there is no evidence that teachers are more at risk for contracting COVID-19 than anyone else going about their daily lives. The science simply doesn\u2019t support the claims that schools put individuals at risk more than any other environment outside of the home.We support the CPS plan to return the city\u2019s children to public school, thank the school administrators putting this plan into action, and would like to see the CTU leadership listen to the experts, stop fighting the return to the classroom with baseless information that invokes fear, and help our communities by supporting our children. In a recent Op-Ed in the Sun Times, members of the Chicago Pediatric and Infectious Disease medical community called this an, \u201cepidemic of serious psychological illness that has reached a crisis point.\u201d Our children need to return to school and the stakes are too high to deny them this.\nIf you are a Chicago parent, sign with us to show support for CPS and get our kids back to school.

If ever there was a time for Americans to take to the streets to denounce fascism and stand up for democracy, the time is now. Activists around America took to the streets this past weekend to march against the attempted fascist coup, exercising their First Amendment rights and standing up for our democracy.&nbsp;\nRamsey Alliance for Social Equity (RASE) was proud to be a part of this day of action. As we have done at every Sunday protest, we gathered and held signs by the train tracks on Main Street. Due to the severity of the threat to our democracy posed by the fascist coup attempt four days earlier, we came to the decision that briefly (less than 10 minutes) marching on one side of Main Street was a pertinent form of protest. We have done this a few times before, always peacefully and safely, and always without incident, often with a Ramsey PD escort.\nWhen we arrived at the destination of our brief march and began to exit the road, Ramsey Police Officer Brian Paul accosted the sole black protester, even though all of the protestors marched together in the road. The encounter ended soon without incident and Ramsey PD presented no charges against me, or anyone else, at that time.&nbsp; After this happened, Ramsey PD was accused of racial profiling, as reported in The Record on January 12.&nbsp; While Chief Gurney defended the actions of Officer Paul, the objective evidence is inconsistent with Chief Gurney\u2019s assertions.&nbsp;\nOn the morning of Wednesday, January 13, Nick Haas (founder of RASE) was served a summons charging him with two disorderly conduct offenses for marching down Main Street during Sunday\u2019s protest. These latent charges appear to be motivated by his perceived role in addressing the racial profiling that occurred on Sunday.\nRASE demands the following:\n1)&nbsp; All charges against Nick Haas dropped immediately.2)&nbsp; Mayor Dillon publicly condemn Officer Brian Paul\u2019s racial profiling, as well as the attempt by Chief Gurney to explain it away contrary to the objective evidence.3)&nbsp; Mayor Dillon publicly condemn the January 6 insurrection attempt at the Capitol in Washington, D.C..4)&nbsp; Ramsey Police Department publicly condemn the January 6 insurrection attempt at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., which resulted in the death of MPD Officer Sicknick, who was originally from NJ.5)&nbsp; Public statement from Ramsey Police Department apologizing for Officer Brian Paul\u2019s racial profiling, as well as for Officer McWilliams not wearing a mask and endangering the public while addressing the protestors, both of which were captured on video Sunday, 1/10.\nPlease sign this petition in support of RASE\u2019s mission to stand up against systemic racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, ableism, and all forms of discrimination as well as demand accountability from Mayor Dillon, Chief Gurney, and the Ramsey PD.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/jo/as/uoJoaSFVcEPxEMn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610649424"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/transition46-cuba-life-saver-not-terrorist-reverse-pompeo-trump-designation?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Cuba: Life saver not terrorist.

Grindline has built hundreds if not thousands of skate parks throughout the United States, which some very well have lights for a evening activity. Now here in stamford Connecticut Scalzi Park has lights for almost every activity, field , court at Scalzi Park except the skate park. From baseball to football to the basketball courts to the tennis courts to even the bocce and handball all are lit up and if I\u2019m not mistaken even the playground itself has lights. The skate park at Scalzi Park in Stamford Connecticut is one of the top attractions at Scalzi Park. Not just opened and played on during days of games or practices. No the skate park is open seven days a week and people from all over come to visit Scalzi skate park.This year alone in 2020 as hard as it was for the world. The skateboarding community at scalzi has came together stronger than ever and has pulled off events and even professional skateboarder\u2018s have came to visit Scalzi Park to visit the skate park. With lights at Scalzi skate park we can achieve Control so it\u2019s not as crowded during the day being able to broaden the range of times that we are able to use the skate park, witch will allow less people at once which is ideal especially during Covid.&nbsp;The city of Stamford should have someone to come fourth and lock the skate parks gate every night so nobody breaks in. Failing to do so results in non-skaters coming in at hours they are not supposed to ruining our place of action sports and put graffiti all over it. That results in two groups being highly upset #1 the city of Stamford because that\u2019s property that they paid for and to most importantly the skateboarders because that\u2019s very dangerous as the paint is 20 times more slip than the original concrete. Graffiti on the skate park alone is liability liability. If stamford was to grant Scalzi skate park lights that would mean that we would be able to solidify a committee to lock the gates at night so no one can further damage to the park and they can also guarantee the younger kids more freedom during their earlier sessions, versus the evening skate sessions the older gentleman can enjoy. &nbsp;With the great power of your voice we can make a change. This is something that the community has Really wanted since 2007. At the moment you can probably see a vast amount of younger kids on scooters with parents and a lot of the times they are put in danger and get in the way of the older kids skateboarding at high speeds resulting in some young kids possibly getting hurt. Even though the rules on the Scalzi skate park fence clearly state this is a skate park not for bikers, rollerbladers nor scooters and that it is also not for beginners. We still allow these kids and families to come in and have a great time and we welcome them with open arms. With&nbsp;lights once again as I reiterate can almost split us up so it\u2019s less of a chance that anyone could either get hurt, sick or furthermore. This isnt something that happens overnight but this is something that can happen. Next year will make it 15 years Scalzi skatepark has been open!!! Wow! I believe it\u2019s time to make this happen!! If You have ever visited Scalzi skate park or enjoyed it over the years be a big help in making this change because I guarantee everybody will be More than happy to see not only lights but a huge change in the structure of the park so we can guarantee safety as far as social distancing, the liability of more paint on the skate park and more.

Below is the text of the press release:&nbsp;\n\"Small Businesses Can Be Saved on Lefferts Boulevard Bridge / Community and Elected Officials Band Together in Response to MTA\u2019s Request for Proposal&nbsp;\nKew Gardens community organizations are partnering with the Mutual Housing Association of&nbsp; New York (MHANY), a not-for-profit housing and commercial property development&nbsp; organization, to submit a unique response to an MTA request for proposal (RFP). The RFP calls&nbsp; for managing the 14 stores that are at the heart of this community\u2019s main shopping area and are&nbsp; situated on the Lefferts Boulevard bridge over the LIRR mainline tracks. This is the first time that&nbsp; a not-for-profit housing and property development organization has pitched to manage MTA-owned properties, and they have done this in conjunction with the community and the store owner&nbsp; representatives with the intent of maintaining the existing character of the buildings.&nbsp;\nThe Lefferts Boulevard Bridge has suffered from years of MTA mismanagement. Because of this neglect, approximately $11 million in capital improvements will be required for the buildings, and&nbsp; an additional $5.5 million will be necessary to repair structural work on the bridge. The MTA&nbsp; expects the master lessee to bear the considerable cost burden of these repairs even after the City&nbsp; has given money to the MTA in the past to make repairs to this structure. The RFP also specifically&nbsp; states that the stores will be delivered empty. Existing small mom and pop stores who have served&nbsp; the community for over 20 years and are already hit hard by the pandemic\u2014will be forced to close&nbsp; under these conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIn response to concerns about the lack of community input (there is no requirement for community&nbsp; involvement in the MTA RFP) and the forced closure of the stores, Kew Gardens\u2019 four state&nbsp; representatives Senators Comrie and Addabbo, Assemblymen Rosenthal and Hevesi, and City&nbsp; Councilwoman Koslowitz sent a letter to the MTA requesting that the RFP be pulled and&nbsp; reformatted to reflect community input and to protect the existing store owners ability to continue&nbsp; to operate. To date, their plea went unanswered.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMHANY\u2019s proposal to operate this property is an inclusive one, allowing for community&nbsp; representation while giving long-time store owners a chance to thrive at affordable rents\u2014rents&nbsp; that for-profit organizations could not provide.

While this review process was deemed comprehensive and collaborative, we feel this is not an accurate description, as the administration failed to speak with any current BFA dance students about their experience in the program. As a result, current students of the program believe it is not only fair, but imperative to fight this decision and make the voice of every person who has been positively impacted by the program heard.\nThe BFA program is designed to set aspiring professional dancers and choreographers up for successful careers in a competitive artistic industry. While the current BA Dance Major is designed for students who have dual interests and wish to double major/minor in another field of study. In comparison to the BFA degree, the BA is an exploratory degree program to study any and all aspects of dance and is more flexible. While the BA degree will still be offered, we are worried that this learning experience for BA\u2019s will be diminished if it is transformed after the BFA deletion.\nWe do not know what all will encompass the deletion of the BFA Dance degree but do know the following are possibilities: cutting some of our class topics, cutting some of our performances, and even cutting possible choreographic opportunities. As mentioned above, these opportunities are vital to the growth of students and would be a devastating loss, not just for the BFA dance students but for all students attending River Campus classes and those with majors that require this experience and knowledge.\nAs current dance students and supporters of the dance program we are deeply affected and incredibly saddened by this decision. This is not just a career; it is a passion; a way of life. Our voices were not accounted for in this decision and given the impact it will have on not just our lives but possibly the future of the dance program, we believe it is imperative to oppose this decision.\nIt is important to oppose the deletion of the BFA Dance Major at Southeast Missouri State University, for the students' voices were not heard during the decision-making process conducted by the university.

The second reason is to plead with those individuals that have a decision in the naming of schools in our district. During the decision making process, please consider honoring this fallen civic leader who served countless days and hours working to progressively improve this school district. The research has shown that this astonishing woman exceeds the qualifications in the naming of the next elementary school or of any school . I am amazed that this has not been presented prior to now. Many current school board members served alongside this extraordinary woman. Within the recent year, I have been involved in many facets of the school district. I am beginning to understand the dynamics in the decision making. This is the reason I am bringing this to your attention. I understand that my request is premature. However, I also know that our town/city is continuing to grow; meaning school populations will increase. This will cause new school construction for our district. I intend to be proactive and persistent so that this subject is on the School Board\u2019s minds and hearts.&nbsp;\nIn my opinion, naming a school after Ms. Eddie Lagway is well deserving and an honor considering her commitment and service to the community and the school district. This community and school district consist of diverse ethnic groups, and all ethnicities should be represented in the community. Ms. Lagway, as many referred to her, was impactful to Willis residents. When mentioning her name alone to individuals in the community, you will be amazed about the conversations. I ask you to research this phenomenal woman. Her death caused a media coverage. Our local newspaper, the Conroe Courier broadcasted her on the front page for several days. You would be stunned about the comments expressed by reporters and community representatives. You will then see the life she lived and how she served in this school district and community and why she is more than qualified and deserving of this huge and amazing honor. Our community took a devastating loss when Ms. Eddie Lagway passed away.\nPlease read my favorite articles about her life and service that I have attached below. Eddie Ruth Lagway Being good at what you do is something that we all strive for in life. ExpertBail Agent Eddie Lagway of Lagway Bail Bonds was no different. She was a fantastic bail agent...but even more importantly she was a fantastic person. Unfortunately, Eddie's time ended last week when she passed away from a heart attack at age 55. She will be solely missed by everyone in her home city of Willis, Texas. Eddie spent her life doing things for others. Whether it was helping someone bail out a family member or just playing a role in her community to help others, she was always doing something positive. To say she was extremely active in her community would be an understatement. From the local school district to her local church, she spent every day trying to make life better for everyone. As a founding member of the city's Community Development Corporation, she played a key role in the city's pocket parks. She also played an active role in the School District as well as founded the WISD Education Foundation, which most recently ensured that the 1967 A.R. Turner High School Football team received their state championship rings. Eddie, you were a wonderful person to know and everyone who ever met you would say the same. We are extremely proud to have worked with you and called you an ExpertBail Agent and a member of our AIA family. We wish you peace. As you can see I am not asking too much in her honor she is a woman who is well deserving of an honor such as naming a school in the district that she served so diligently.

It also paves the way for other projects to irrevocably change the look and feel of Lake Forest forever. Additionally, existing Lake Forest property owners and taxpayers, who purchased their properties under the current zoning, stand to lose value on their homes. Historic districts are created as a way to protect and preserve the most valuable attributes of the community.

As per India's constitution, the central&nbsp;government&nbsp;of India cannot create laws for the agricultural sector. It is within the right of a state\u2019s government to create agricultural laws.\nModi's&nbsp;government&nbsp;passed&nbsp;agricultural laws&nbsp;in both houses without discussing them with the oppositional party members which are against the practice of parliament.&nbsp;\nThese laws will completely privatize India's agricultural sector. Farmers will be trapped under the contract of large corporate houses indefinitely. Farming has been a hereditary profession for the farmers and these laws will ruin their livelihood since they were legislated to assist corporate players.\nNo farming organization requested for the creation of these laws, which questions the objective behind its introduction.&nbsp;\nPrior to the protest, the farmers stated that they would march peacefully towards Delhi and protest there through peaceful practices.&nbsp;When the group of farmers was approaching Delhi to protest, Modi\u2019s government took egregious actions to stop them. They created immense holes on national highways, utilized water cannons, tear gas, and baton charges in the cold weather to cease the farmers.\nModi is the leader of democracy; however, he has taken an inhuman approach toward the protesting farmers, resembling the actions of a dictatorship.

We are extremely&nbsp;concerned about the educational, emotional, social and physical health of our children. &nbsp;Collectively we have established this petition so that our voices are united and strongly heard in hopes that we can be instrumental in the redevelopment of the educational model currently in place.\nWe feel it is vital for our children\u2019s educational development that they receive five consecutive days of in person instruction each week, for a minimum of four hours a day. While we know there are challenges to be met in doing so, we are certain that our team of educators, health professionals and parents can come together to make this an achievable goal for the good of Livingston\u2019s students. &nbsp;\nHaving five days/week of in-person school is essential for our children who choose to do so. The CDC, and the NJ Department of Health allow in person school five days per week, therefore we see no reason why the Livingston Board of Education cannot resolve the issues at hand and get our children back in school. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), opening schools does not significantly increase community transmission when guidance outlined by the CDC are followed, especially with young learners. The AAP also explains that that desks may be placed three feet apart when six feet is not feasible; and that harm may outweigh the potential benefits of strict adherence to a six feet spacing rule.&nbsp;\nArticles written by highly respected national education leaders have pointed out the deficits our children will face now and in the future due to the lack of in person school and services. &nbsp;The effect of nearly a year or more of remote and/or hybrid learning will more than likely have a lasting effect on their long term educational success and college and career goals. In addition, the extreme levels of isolation they have experienced since March must be eliminated by creating a new model that reverses this devastating blow to both their mental and physical growth. &nbsp; &nbsp;\nWe are certain that the current cohort model does not meet the needs of elementary school learners. Many districts throughout Essex County and the broader tri-state area have worked hard and have found ways to bring students safely and successfully back into the schools every day. While some schools are open for five half days and the children eat lunch at home, others have been open for five full days, eating lunch safely at school. Many private schools in our immediate area have also allowed for students to be in school for a full day, every day. &nbsp;We strongly believe that if they can do it Livingston can too.&nbsp;\nAccording to Dr. Block there are forty homerooms across the elementary schools that cannot fit students in the classrooms six feet apart. Many other schools seat their children less than six feet apart with plexiglass surrounding them. This has been successful in various schools throughout New Jersey, as well as many on Long Island and Westchester. These districts have utilized other staff members to watch the class during lunch so teachers can receive their break. Many districts that cannot accommodate the entire class seated six feet apart, utilize large spaces such as the cafeteria, library, gym and other common areas.\nWe as parents, voters and tax payers, know that the Livingston school district is rich in resources and can creatively work together to support an elementary cohort model which provides a consistent schedule of five days a week for in person, in school learning for students who choose to do so. &nbsp;This new model must be cast without delay for the sake of our children, the learners you have committed to educating. &nbsp;We request that you include some parents as part of the team in creating the new model. The current hybrid model, which has our children coming to school less than 5 days/week does not meet the standards that we consider essential for our children, and therefore please know that we no longer support it.\nWe implore you to make the necessary changes to the current elementary hybrid model. We strongly believe and are confident that Livingston Public Schools as leaders in education can find resolution to the setbacks this virus has caused. In doing so, our children can once again thrive academically, socially and emotionally. &nbsp;Thank you for your attention.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/zh/dp/jNzHdpxBznDaFyI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610667506"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/norwood-ohio-keep-911-services-in-norwood?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Keep 911 services in Norwood!", "description": "\u203c\ufe0f URGENT \u203c\ufe0f\nIF YOU OR A LOVED ONE LIVES/WORKS IN NORWOOD OR OWNS A BUSINESS OR PROPERTY IN NORWOOD, PLEASE READ THIS!!!\nMayor Victor Schneider has decided to get rid of the Norwood Communications Center.

While well-intentioned, there's been no communication regarding parameters required to re-open our playgrounds for children to play. [Chart of open vs. closed city playgrounds across the State of Texas for reference.]\nThe goal of this petition is to prompt local RGV city and county-level officials to re-open playgrounds. The alternative, acceptable result would be to clearly communicate what benchmarks we can expect as communities to allow for playground re-openings.&nbsp;\n\nMany Texas cities never closed playgrounds or have already re-opened given the lack of evidence supporting playgrounds are a source of virus-spread. \u201cThere is no science that indicates a playground or overnight camping is more dangerous than hiking or going to the beach,\u201d said Dr. Monica Gandhi, medical professor of infectious diseases at the University of California-San Francisco. \u201cOutdoors is much more safe than indoors and we should be encouraging activities and exercise during this difficult time as we get to the final stretch of the pandemic waiting for vaccines. Moreover, surface transmission is not a factor in spread. This is a respiratory virus.\u201d\nThere are discrepancies among RGV cities as to which cities are allowed to have playgrounds opened &amp; this is confusing and contradicting to the narrative that playgrounds are \"unsafe.\" [See chart]\nNot every family has access to a safe neighborhood, personal playground equipment, or backyard to play in. While parks are open, the utilization rate has dropped since playgrounds are not available.&nbsp;\nWe believe that issues such as lack of access to playgrounds are further exacerbating the challenges children face in this region such as childhood obesity and other socioeconomic disadvantages that prevent them from using indoor, commercial facilities for play that are proved to be less safe.\n\u201cPlaygrounds are not optional, they are essential. Play is how children develop executive function, cognitive abilities and gross motor skills. Playgrounds are vital urban infrastructure, particularly for those who live without equitable access to outdoor space. The need for structured places to play outside is especially important now, when children are stuck at home without in-person school, team sports or physical education. Not only do swings and slides in playgrounds let kids get the exercise they need for healthy sleep patterns, but outside play is also critical in helping kids settle down for online learning.\u201d\nGuidelines such as mask-wearing would still be required and parents would be responsible for assisting children with distancing and hand-sanitization. City parks may also place an occupancy limit and hand-sanitizing stations. The discretion of parents, as in many other locations (playground or non) is something that we face in our decision-making process and the same applies to playground use. \n\nThis petition does not, in any way, make light of the seriousness of the pandemic. We acknowledge that the spread of this virus in a playground setting is not 100% preventable and realize that many city decisions are to avoid liability and community spread. However, the consequences of not re-opening are very serious and will have long-term effects on children's mental and physical well-being in the RGV communities.

There is absolutely nothing glamorous about dead animals or loved ones. There are plenty of alternatives which are of great quality. There should be no space for these now. Law needs to be passed to make the fur trade illegal all across the world, in order to force companies to work with alternative material and stop glamorizing the fur product.\nGovernments cannot respond to this crisis simply by culling millions of animals and then allowing farmers to return to business as usual. The appalling conditions on fur farms make them a ticking time bomb for pandemic disease risk.&nbsp;Twenty countries have already acted to ban the farming of animals for their fur because it is cruel, outdated, and unnecessary.

GWA\u2019s football team has thrived under Coach Davis\u2019s leadership, and he is a trusted, lifelong educator and coach who works with integrity and passion. Coach Davis teaches his players how to play the difficult games of football and life, instilling Christian principles of grace and forgiveness while striving for excellence and discovering their best selves. We understand that Dr. Dolan, as Head of School, has ultimate and unilateral power to hire and fire faculty and staff without board oversight or approval. As current and future investors in GWA, we insist the by-laws be amended to mandate board oversight and approval for staff and faculty hiring and firing, and, in the case of the coaches, to include the Athletic Director\u2019s concurrence.

When protestors questioned why Prusayev was not wearing a mask and exercised their First Amendment rights to demand justice for Hill and all Black Lives lost to police violence, Prusayev responded by pulling out his gun in the direction of protestors, which included members of the BIPOC community.&nbsp;\nPrusayev then looked at the female officer, who did not draw her gun, and put his gun back in his holster. Moments later, however, Prusayev pulled out an expandable baton, aggressively whipping it open.&nbsp;\nThis is a clear show of excessive force, and was in fact condemned by Keith Ross, a former master instructor for the NYPD Police Academy.&nbsp;\nProtestors did not touch, menace, or threaten Prusayev. They held phones, not weapons, in their hands. There is no justification for his actions.

Not killing life, the Buddha seed grows.Transmit the life of Buddha and do not kill\u2014Eihei Dogen Zenji\nEvery version of the Buddha\u2019s ethical precepts begins with this principle: Do Not Kill. Buddha and all the great spiritual teachers \u2014 Jesus, Mohammed, the Hebrew prophets, Gandhi \u2014 tell us that life is sacred; that violence only begets violence. The logic of cause and effect, karma and its fruit, are inescapable even when you dress them in the emperor or president\u2019s clothes of punitive and retributive justice.On November 25, 2020 the U.S. Justice Department announced new regulations allowing for the use of new, or rather, old methods for federal executions, including the firing squad and electrocution. According to The New York Times:\nLast week, the Justice Department announced that it plans to execute three more inmates on federal death row. If the administration does so, along with two other executions already scheduled, it will have put 13 prisoners to death since July, marking one of the deadliest periods in the history of federal capital punishment since at least 1927\u2026\nAs Soto Zen Buddhist priests and teachers, as people of faith, we vigorously oppose state-sponsored murder and this rush to punish. We see capital punishment as the enactment of a cruel and primitive urge for vengeance draped in the fabric of legality. We believe that capital punishment degrades and brutalizes our society by teaching violence in reaction to violence.The harm of capital punishment does not just fall on the person put to death, but on our whole society \u2014 on guards and technicians, wardens, governors, on families of victims, and on each of us allowing this barbarism to go forward in our name.Capital punishment is the cutting edge of America\u2019s penal system. Social scientists, clergy, politicians, and communities of color all know that this is a broken system, although it is remarkably effective for sowing the seeds of violence. We see no evidence or statistics that capital punishment serves as an effective deterrent to crime. Resting on a foundation of inequality, based on racism and privilege, capital punishment cannot be fixed. Let\u2019s end it now, everywhere!People of faith and conscience wish to build a new system of justice based on love, restoration, and redemption. Let those be the lights that guide us. We believe that social and personal transformation are always possible, and that even wounded people can change and contribute to society. While it is true that people reasonably expect protection from those who\u2014by reason of mental illness, and extreme physical or psychological trauma \u2014 prey on others, the great majority of all prisoners are capable of transformation. This is our understanding of human nature. As for the handful who must be restrained or separated for their own protection and the safety of others, even these prisoners must be afforded life, a humane environment, and the possibility of meaningful work.We believe that there is no fair or practical way to arrive at a sentence of death. Our criminal justice system is so weighted against the poor and against men and women of color that an even application of the law is impossible. In recent years we have seen many death sentences overturned by new DNA evidence and prosecutorial misconduct. We also see that capital cases are often based on forced confessions, mistaken identification, and jailhouse informants. To continue with capital punishment in its present state means that more innocent people will be executed.In his version of the First Precept, Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh writes: \u201cI am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to condone any killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of life.\u201d This is pretty straightforward, but the hard work is before us.What is our work? Organize against the death penalty in your communities, in your centers and temples. Study and talk about the death penalty; debate it with your friends. Write to the U.S. Attorney General and the President\u2014outgoing and incoming\u2014and speak your opposition and convictions. When federal or state executions are scheduled, join with sisters and brothers of all faiths sitting at the prison gates to bear witness. This is important. We must speak for humane policy and compassion with our bodies. Verse 129 of the Dhammapada, Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s early teaching, says: \u201cAll tremble at violence; all fear death. Putting oneself in the place of another, one should not kill nor cause another to kill.\u201d May we live with this awareness and save all beings.\n\u2022 We ask the U. S. Federal Government to immediately halt all planned Federal Executions.\u2022 We ask for a Nationwide moratorium on Federal and State Executions.\u2022 We ask for our legislatures to reform the justice system to be one of restoration and redemption.\nAction Items and Information on the Death Penaltyhttp://deathpenaltyaction.org/take-actionhttps://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-congress-abolish-the-federal-death-penalty/https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/https://action.aclu.org/petition/stop-federal-executionshttps://catholicsmobilizing.org/take-action-stop-federal-executions-1", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/kl/eh/oVKlEHkaYMowFRn-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606768082"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/greece-must-recognize-the-albanian-genocide?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Greece must: Recognize the Albanian Genocide!", "description": "The Greek government should&nbsp;Recognize&nbsp;and&nbsp;Apologize&nbsp;to the Albanian people for the brutal Genocide conducted by The Greek (para) military and headed by Greek General Napoleon Zervas in 1944 in the region of Chameria. Thousands of innocent women children and elderly were slaughtered in the most inhumane way, burned alive, beheaded, beaten to death, shot, raped in-front of their children and killed. Thousands of survivors were forced to walk to Albania where many died during the trail. The survivors are still banned to return back to their homes or even visit their parents' graves.&nbsp;Exactly seventy-six years ago, in 1944, Greek authorities under resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. On June 27, 1944 more than 600 men, women, and children were massacred in a town called Paramithia.&nbsp; From June 1944 to March, 1945, 1286 people were killed in the town of Filat. 626 people were massacred in Margellic and Parga and 192 were killed in Gumenica. In total, 2900 men, 214 women, 96 children were killed.&nbsp; 745 women were raped. 32 children, who were less than 3 years of age, were massacred. 68 villages of Chameria were razed to the ground. 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down. Valuable property that belonged to the Chams was confiscated.&nbsp;The 1912 Ottoman Census about Chameria illustrates the following: There are five major regions within Chameria:(1) Gumenitza (with 10,126 Albanians)(2) Filati (22,348 Albanians)(3) Paramithia (13,780 Albanians)(4) Margariti (15,732 Albanians)(5) Parga (800 Albanians).&nbsp;\nThe total number of people in these territories, the census states, was 71,983. Out of this population 62,786 were Albanians. The rest were Greeks and some Jews.&nbsp;\nWE DEMAND:1. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on the Greek government to recognize the existence of the 80,000 Albanians living in Chameria today and all other ethnic minorities in Greece.&nbsp; In spite of the fact that Greece is a member of NATO and the European Union and that it has signed all international covenants on human rights, the Greek government officially denies the existence of Chamerians and all other ethnic minorities in Greece.&nbsp; Greek citizens of Albanian, Turkish, Macedonian, Vlach, and Roma descent do not enjoy fair and equitable treatment under the law and face enormous obstacles in preserving their culture and exercising their right to freedom of expression and freedom of religion.&nbsp; The international community must make Greece accountable for its failure to recognize ethnic minorities living inside their borders and to protect their rights.\n2. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on the Greek government to publicly apologize for the fact that \u201cChams\u201d were the victims of successive waves of mass expulsion and genocide, culminating in the massacre of more than 5,000 men, women, and children, the forcible expulsion to Albania and Turkey of 35,000 more, the confiscation of thousands of acres of Cham-owned land, and the looting and burning of 68 Albanian villages and towns and a hundred mosques from June 1944 to March 1945. &nbsp;\n3. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on the Greek government to recognize the right of Cham survivors and their descendants in exile to return to their land and to receive recompense for their destroyed and stolen assets, involving approximately 150,000 people and property valued at more than two billion dollars in today\u2019s market.&nbsp; It is incredible that the Greek government, which condoned the seizure of Cham property in law at the end of World War II, has denied the survivors and their descendants even the right to visit their ancestral lands.\n4. Albanian Roots NGO is calling on Greece to respect the human and civil rights of Chams, as well as the rights of approximately 500,000 Albanians living in Greece today as temporary workers.&nbsp; Albanians in Greece seek equal protection under the law, freedom from forced assimilation and governmental repression, and opportunities for public employment and education in their own language.&nbsp; They should enjoy the same rights that the Greek minority enjoys in Albania. &nbsp;\n5. Albanian Roots NGO believes that to successfully resolve the Cham problem, Albanian Americans need to educate the West about Chameria (\u00c7am\u00ebria) and to create a strategy for \u201cinternationalizing\u201d the Cham problem. &nbsp; We need to make it clear that Chamerians (Albanians of Greece) are requesting recognition of their ethnicity, the restoration of their human and civil rights, the right to use the Albanian language, the restitution of their assets, and the right of return. This effort will not be easy, because the Greek lobby is one of the largest contributors to House and Senate reelection races in the United States, and Western Europe is reluctant to take on any issue that can potentially destabilize its neighbors to the south.&nbsp; But the diplomatic path must be taken and played out in 21st century terms. Justice, so long denied to Chameria, is finally to be achieved.&nbsp; &nbsp;LINKS:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-albania-greece-chams-idUSKCN1G80OOhttps://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/albanias-cham-population-wants-greek-apology-for-wartime-expulsion/https://in.news.yahoo.com/albanias-chams-want-greek-apology-wartime-expulsion-154239105--sector.html?soc_src=social-sh&amp;soc_trk=mahttps://eu.greekreporter.com/2018/02/25/albanias-chams-demand-apology-from-greece-photos/http://illyriapress.com/75-years-of-chamerian-genocide-by-greece/https://albanianstudies.weebly.com/cham-issue.htmlhttp://www.albanianhistory.net/1946_Cham-Albanians/index.htmlhttps://albanianroots.com/albanian-genocide-by-greece-75-year-anniversary/\nVideo Testimonies of Survivors:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RTuSBaoagshttps://youtu.be/_eMisOWySzMVideo Documentaries:Italian Documentary - https://youtu.be/7DehrZjdW68https://youtu.be/vsjWIjO1gychttps://youtu.be/m4z7dT0ZMschttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BbAyDBMoEUhttps://youtu.be/OgI0VE0DH0whttps://youtu.be/Zc2imOlc79YPhotos of Cham Albanian Refugees - &nbsp;UN Archives&nbsp;http://www.albanianphotography.net/cham/\nGreek scientists accept Greek's - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5dePt4U74Ihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsjUKLn9c94&amp;feature=emb_logo\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/ai/xu/WVaiXuWFzvwHhsb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610045630"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/bend-lapine-school-district-keep-education-online-until-after-vaccinations-have-been-locally-distributed?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Keep education online until after vaccinations have been locally distributed!", "description": "Covid 19 has created hardships for everyone.Education is more difficult virtually but this does not give us a reason to open in person schooling while cases are still astronomical.

Despite this, the county\u2019s Development Advisory Board (DAC) has approved the destruction of 326 acres of this mature forest in the Bush River Watershed. The headwaters of the Haha Branch and a large portion of the stream flow through this forest, and the mature trees and wetlands filter the water flowing to the Chesapeake Bay. The Maryland Department of the Environment has said that every tributary flowing into the Chesapeake is critically important to help manage the massive levels of water pollution, and protect the Bay.\nWhile Abingdon Woods is a crucial part of protecting the Bay, this beautiful forest also improves the quality of life for county residents. This forest is in the middle of a residential area, and directly adjacent to an elementary school. The current pandemic has highlighted the importance of having access to the outdoors. Sadly, many residents living in the development envelope don\u2019t have access to trails or the luxury of open space. They can\u2019t \u201csocial distance\u201d without standing in a parking lot or keeping their kids indoors all day. In this time of crisis, Harford County\u2019s decision to turn this incredibly beautiful and ecologically important forest into parking lots and warehouses is both horrifying and irresponsible. Worse still, it will be paved over to build more large warehouses and parking lots in the middle of a residential area along Route 40, where there are currently 18 existing vacant warehouses in Joppatowne alone.\nThis forest in the Bush River watershed is crucial for water quality, provides essential habitat, regulates the climate, cleans the air and is essential to the wellbeing and safety of the citizens within the development envelope, who deserve open space too. The county council and county administration have ignored their own county planners who identified the Abingdon Forest as \u201ca Core Forest which should be protected and preserved\u201d, as part of Harford County\u2019s Green Infrastructure Plan.\nSo who is doing this? The property is owned by the Chesapeake Real Estate Group, led by former Maryland Secretary of Transportation James Lighthizer.&nbsp;The proposed development plan has been allowed to proceed because of the questionable practices of the Harford County Council, led by County Executive Barry Glassman. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation is currently challenging the County\u2019s approval of the forestry management plan, which is completely inadequate. A local group, Harford County Climate Action, is raising money to file an injunction to try to prevent the County from rushing the destruction of the forest to avoid a court ruling.\nWe are asking the Harford County Council, and specifically County Executive Barry Glassman, to act now to stop this destruction. The Council can ensure that no action is taken to destroy the site while court cases proceed. But more importantly, there are numerous funding sources available to preserve the site. We urge the County to use Open Source funding to purchase the site from the Chesapeake Real Estate Group, and turn it into a public park.\nCheck out the GoFundMe page set up by Harford County Climate Action to pay for the court costs of the injunction, and see the video put together by residents and activists: https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-abingdon-woods?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet", "image_url": "https://static.change.org/profile-img/default-user-profile.svg"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/u-s-senate-hold-roger-marshall-accountable-for-his-actions?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Hold Roger Marshall accountable for his actions", "description": "On November 3, 2020, Roger Marshall was elected to the US senate by the state of Kansas.\nOn January 3, 2021, Roger Marshall was sworn into the US senate, swearing to represent the people and interests of Kansas whether they voted for him or not.

At the beginning of this school year, Shore Regional adapted its schedule to better accommodate the needs of its students, parents, teachers, and support staff. We are petitioning to stop the planned changes of the schedule and continue with the schedule we have had for the entire 2020/2021 school year.&nbsp;\nIn summary, we respectfully request that the schedule remain the same. For the following reasons:\n\nSanitation\nEfficient class periods\nPredictability\n\nVirtual Wednesdays provide numerous benefits. Most prominent is the capacity to properly sanitize the school. This day provides a buffer between the two cohorts which greatly reduces the potential pool of people exposed in the case a student or teacher tested positive for Covid-19. The recent events at Frank Antonides and Betty McElmon in West Long Branch where&nbsp;45 people&nbsp;were exposed and&nbsp;5 people&nbsp;tested positive highlight just how important this is.&nbsp;\nAdditionally, virtual Wednesdays are a great opportunity for teachers to assign work and review lessons in the middle of the week. In many classes, teachers will review homework or a lesson during the thirty-minute class period on Wednesday and administer the test on Thursday or Friday. Many find that a ninety-minute block is just not necessary for these simpler tasks.\nFinally, the predictability of the current schedule is invaluable. As it stands, the schedule is highly predictable. Every Monday and Thursday is a blue day, every Tuesday and Friday is a white day, and Wednesday is a virtual day. This makes scheduling doctor's appointments and other daily tasks much easier in advance as we know what classes we have and when we have them.

In passing the Act, Congress inserted an amendment, Sec. 3 (b), directing the federal government to do nothing for American bison held in sacred public trust as wildlife: \u201cNothing in this Act or the adoption of the North American bison as the national mammal of the United States shall be construed or used as a reason to alter, change, modify, or otherwise affect any plan, policy, management decision, regulation, or other action by the Federal Government.\u201d\nThe American bison, held in sacred public trust as wildlife, needs protection!\nWe cannot honor our National Mammal, and their relationship to Native Americans, by allowing the indiscriminate slaughter of the Yellowstone bison. This is the one place the migratory species still roams their native habitat in the United States. The Yellowstone bison are unique, requiring special attention and action, distinguished as the only bison to continuously inhabit their original range in the United States, and comprised of genetically distinct sub-populations, the Central and Northern herds.

The reason I am making this petition (and hoping it blows up) is on behalf of my younger brother. My younger brother is also deaf, and he always asks me, \"What are they saying?\" My brother and I are huge football fans, and while we love the game of football, we also enjoy watching clips and behind-the-scenes. As an individual who can hear, I enjoy watching the NFL Mic'd Up&nbsp;series or the SoundFX clips on YouTube and NFL.com. However, my brother does not get to enjoy these same clips, especially when they are promoted nationwide on social media outlets such as Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and so forth.&nbsp;\nAfter scanning the internet for hours and having no luck in finding videos of the \"NFL Mic'd Up\" with closed-captioning, I have decided to turn to Change.org to help the NFL become more inclusive with the Deaf Community. I tried finding an appropriate contact for the NFL, but I felt like my request would be --unironically-- unheard. The goal is to provide entertainment to football fans, but there is an entire community that is missing out. Now more than ever, there has been a bigger desire to provide equality and equity to individuals who cannot hear on the internet with big media outlets (like NowThisNews) providing closed captioning on their videos so EVERYONE can enjoy it.\nMy brother and I are huge football fans, and it hurts my heart to know that I can enjoy certain things while he can't. For my entire life, I have never deemed myself as \"better,\" and truthfully have never viewed my brother as \"less\" or allowing his disability to limit who he is as an individual. However, this is one area that I want to support him because he deserves to enjoy the same things I get to, and it's truly an easy fix that the NFL can do to make their content more accessible for ALL. Even with YouTube's text to speech option, it is not 100% accurate and I believe that the NFL could easily add closed-captioning to these clips, as well as potentially adding them to other content such as Fantasy Football or regular football clips.\nPlease sign this petition so I can present it to the NFL and provide my family, along with countless other deaf football fans, the benefit of enjoying the same content that I and millions of other football fans enjoy on a daily basis. The NFL is taking strides towards encouraging equality for all, and this goes hand-in-hand in supporting fans who are Deaf, and so my brother can continue to enjoy the same things I can.\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/je/re/twjERekWlOUiakO-800x450-noPad.jpg?1603923170"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/law-students-virginia-anti-death-penalty-bill-sb1165?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Virginia Anti-Death Penalty Bill SB1165", "description": "In this new year, we Virginians have the rare chance to effect positive change to our judicial system - a system that has institutionalized inequity and unjust applications of the law against marginalized communities for years. As students of Virginia\u2019s law schools, we take seriously the responsibility to shape our legal system and are compelled to take a stand in the face of institutional failures. This General Assembly session, state legislators will have the opportunity to vote on a House and a Senate bill to abolish capital punishment in Virginia. The death penalty is rooted in systemic racism and reflects our country\u2019s history of oppression and injustice. We, the undersigned, are united in our request that the Virginia General Assembly formally abolish capital punishment during the current session.\nThe year 2020 taught us many lessons, but one was particularly critical: to take a stand for racial justice and to do so loudly - not only advocating for equitable treatment of vulnerable populations, but implementing real change to archaic institutions. The death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent and gives the state the final word on another human\u2019s life. It is rooted in revenge, economically inefficient, and is riddled with racial bias.\nIn Virginia, the death penalty is a remnant of the Jim Crow era. Today, a Black person is seven times more likely to be sentenced to death for a crime than their white counterpart. In addition, only four wealthy suburban jurisdictions (out of 133) have been the driving force behind death penalty sentences since 1982. Equality, justice and uniformity of the law are cornerstones of our judicial system\u2014capital punishment ignores these.\nTo those still in favor of capital punishment, we urge you to reflect on the words of Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative - Stevenson once said that the threshold question for the death penalty should not be \u201cDo people deserve to die for the crimes they have committed?\u201d but rather, \u201cDo we deserve to kill?\u201d In a penal system full of human error, racial bias, class bias, and arbitrary application, the answer to the latter question must be a resounding no.\nWe must acknowledge our past and collectively work towards a better future for our commonwealth. Virginia is second only to Texas in executions since 1976.&nbsp; The era of state-sanctioned vengeance killings can end with us. This month, the Virginia General Assembly has the opportunity to be the first southern state to abolish capital punishment and be an example to the remaining twenty-five states still actively using the death penalty.\nWe, the undersigned Virginia law students, call for an end to capital punishment in Virginia. Staying silent is no longer an option. Now is the time to let our voices be heard.\nSign this petition, call, write, and email your state legislators. Urge them to vote in favor of abolishing capital punishment. Share this petition with five friends and ask them to do the same. Governor Northam has said that he would sign an abolition bill should it appear on his desk. We have never been closer to eradicating the death penalty in Virginia. Our actions in the coming months must reflect the urgency of this opportunity, and what it would mean for the lives of the current two inmates on Virginia\u2019s death row, their families, and future defendants in our commonwealth. This is a question of justice and equity, of attempting to repair a broken system and fix the wrongs of our past. Demonstrate your support by signing this petition and help put an end to the death penalty.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/yw/wj/mkYwwjvlXtVKmtF-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610487954"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/twitter-inc-twitter-and-facebook-permanently-ban-donald-trump?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Twitter and Facebook: Permanently Ban Donald Trump", "description": "After Donald Trump used social media to incite an armed insurrection and domestic terrorist attack on the United States Capitol, his continued presence on Twitter and Facebook is a clear and present danger.&nbsp;\nWhile it is commendable that Twitter and Facebook temporarily suspended Trump from their platforms on Wednesday, these suspensions must become permanent bans. \nSince Twitter lifted Trump\u2019s suspension, he has started to again use the platform to encourage violence and to spread dangerous disinformation.&nbsp;There will be plenty of time to debate whether Twitter and Facebook should have taken away Trump\u2019s social media accounts sooner, yet his continued access puts tens of millions of Americans at imminent risk of harm.&nbsp;\nWe implore Twitter and Facebook to do the right thing and permanently ban Donald Trump.

He had no history of violence, and provided employment to a lot of people that others had turned their backs on. To date, Mr. Blalock sits in jail, while the true killer(s) continue to live life freely. Mr. Blalock was framed for this crime due to unrequited love coupled with vindictive prosecution.

A beautiful location with many outdoor activities. We have a gorgeous lake, exceptional trails, winter activities, and incredible landscape just to name a few.

It will create a safe, fun, and friendly environment for our children and adults that enjoy skateboarding, roller blading, scootering and BMX riding. This park will encourage people of all ages to get outside, exercise, and&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;one of the worlds most popular hobbies. A public skatepark will be a viable addition to give our local youth a safe place to enjoy skating rather than having to rely on busy streets and shopping centers. Lastly, a skatepark will keep our children active, and give them an environment&nbsp;to spend time with friends and family in an outdoor setting.&nbsp;If this petition is approved, we believe this local skatepark will benefit our already growing community.

This notification came from superintendent, Dr. Dan Shelton, based on the recommendation of Governor John Carney.&nbsp;\nWe demand that all schools within the Christina School District remain in the Remote Instruction model until the daily new cases within New Castle County trend below 100 for a 2 week average.&nbsp;\nBased on the current data, Delaware had 1,241 new positive cases on January 6, 2021. Percent of people testing positive stood at 28% and percent of tests positivity presented at 9.9%. There are currently 453 hospitalizations, 57 critical. In addition to these numbers, the State of Delaware dismantled the School Safety Dashboard which cited the parameters used for community safety. Prior to its deletion, the criteria stated that once the state reached a rolling average of 8% test positivity, schools would implement remote learning only to limit community spread. Upon Governor Carney\u2019s announcement on January 5th, the dashboard ceased to exist and a new dashboard named In-Person Contagious School Cases took its place. There are no longer any state mandated criteria to guide the safety of community spread within schools.&nbsp;\nDPH does not offer \u201cschools\u201d as a venue where infection could have occurred for contact tracing purposes. Therefore, there is no valid data proving that schools are not an environment where COVID-19 is spread. In addition, in New Castle County,&nbsp; the number of cases per 10,000 people for ages 5-17 is 452.5. This data proves that children do indeed get the virus and are able to spread. Since our students are maskless for both breakfast and lunch, it is impossible to guarantee safety to those around them.&nbsp;\nMaintaining remote instruction not only provides a consistent schedule for our youth, but also limits exposures within the community. It allows for a 5 day a week equitable education and ensures not one staff member or student&nbsp; is exposed inside a Christina School District building to a potentially fatal virus.

We were blessed to have incredible talent like Patti Murin as Anna, Caissie Levy as Elsa, Jelani Alladin as Kristoff, John Riddle as Hans, Greg Hildreth as Olaf, and so many wonderful men and women who encompassed both the supporting characters and ensemble of this amazing show.The story, sets, songs, and characters took on a whole new dimension as it was brought to life on stage, and as Olaf so eloquently put it, \"Some things are worth melting for.\" I was lucky to see this show twice on Broadway with much of the original cast, and it was truly a magical experience.Like so many fans, we were saddened by the departure of much of the original cast in early 2020 but were excited and hopeful by the incoming talent of great actors who would replace Patti Murin and Caissie Levy as Anna and Elsa. McKenzie Kurtz and Ciara Ren\u00e9e would take on the roles with grace, energy, and passion as the original leading ladies have done for the past two years (including their out of town tryouts in Denver, CO). Also joining these ladies was Ryan McCartan (well-known from Liv &amp; Maddie and Wicked), and they officially had their first Broadway performances on 18 February 2020. (I would also like to mention that Noah J. Ricketts and Ryann Redmond were promoted to their respective roles as Kristoff and Olaf after Jelani Alladin and Greg Hildreth left the show in 2019.)Then, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and Broadway was shut down on 12 March 2020.Ms. Kurtz, Ms. Ren\u00e9e, and Mr. McCartan only had the opportunity to play Anna, Elsa, and Hans for roughly three weeks. Much of the cast and crew were keeping their fingers crossed that they would be able to return to the show once the pandemic was over. Then, a dark day came for Frozen fans across the country on 14 May 2020. Disney announced that Frozen would not be returning to Broadway when the pandemic ended.I was crushed, to say the least, along with hundreds, even millions, of others who had the chance to see this show more than once or hadn't even seen the show at all. What was especially heartbreaking was that Ms. Kurtz's Broadway debut was cut so drastically short by the pandemic, and many of the actors and crew members associated with the show are now out of work.Disney had the opportunity to do a filmed stage version of the award-winning Broadway version of Newsies in 2017 with Jeremy Jordan, Kara Lindsay, Andrew Keenan Bolger, Ben Frankhauser, and Tommy Bracco reprising their roles from the original Broadway show. It was a hit among fans of the show and continues to be enjoyed by individuals of all ages. And who could forget releasing the filmed stage version of Hamilton with the original Broadway cast on Disney+ to resounding fanfare in 2020?What's to stop Disney from doing a filmed stage version of Frozen? Especially with the cast members who's time in Arendelle was cut so short by the pandemic?&nbsp;Fans of both the movie and the Broadway musical want a filmed stage version of Frozen with this cast so it can be shown to audiences across the country and around the world. Yes, I am aware that the national tour began their travels across the country and several cities around the world slated to have the show premiere on stage when the pandemic is over if it hasn't already. But we want the most recent Broadway cast who took the roles to heart before it ended all too soon so we can enjoy it for many years to come.To the Walt Disney Company and Disney on Broadway, please hear our cry: make a filmed stage version of Frozen the Musical with McKenzie Kurtz, Ciara Ren\u00e9e, Ryan McCartan, and the rest of the most recent Broadway cast reprising their roles. We would watch it over and over again, and you owe it to the fans all over the country and the world to bring this story to new fans and those of us who have seen it over a dozen times. Plus, it would inspire a new generation of fans to go see live theatre if Frozen the Musical was filmed and made accessible to audiences across the country and the world.Please consider making a filmed stage version of Frozen the Musical with Mckenzie Kurtz, Ciara Ren\u00e9e, Ryan McCartan, and the rest of the most recent Broadway cast reprising their roles before the pandemic shut down the show for good. Please listen to the fans who enjoy this story very much, and let this show be accessible to all of us.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/ru/xk/XARUxKDcZdVtkIt-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609039104"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/chris-jacobs-stop-companies-from-destroying-parler?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop Companies From Destroying Parler", "description": "Parler is a beacon of free speech and it most be protected at all costs.

I went to one semester of culinary classes and obtained my ServSafe Food Protection Managers Certification Examination, which is accredited by The American National Standards Institute(ANSI)- Conference for Food Protection (CFP) on September 28. When my family and friends started sharing and posting on social media my cakes and cupcakes, word spread and soon, I had people asking me to bake them special cakes and desserts. During this time, I was also in the process of researching what it takes to get a business license and purchasing a business name. I created a business page on Facebook and thought it was going well.\nOn the night of, January 12, I received a letter from the Monroe County Health Department stating there was a complaint filed against me and I had to cease operation of my food service immediately. On January 13, I researched the \u201cCottage Food Act\u201d and the \u201cCupcake Act\u201d. The Cottage Food Act states that I cannot make more than $25,000 per year, allowed to bake out of my private kitchen but only selling my desserts at a Farmers Market. The Cupcake Act was enacted in ONLY eight out of 102 counties in Illinois - Monroe County NOT being one of those eight. The Cupcake Act was put in place 2014 by a 12-year old girl from Troy, IL. This Act allows bakers to bake and sell out of their home kitchen as long as they inform their customers that their kitchen has not been inspected. It also states that I can only make less than $1,000 in gross profit per month. Since a Farmers Market only runs during warm weather (May through October), how would I be able to sell my product - I can\u2019t. And since Monroe County has not enacted the Cupcake Act, I still cannot sell my beautiful cakes and desserts.

The neighborhood of Kensington in the city of Philadelphia is the epicenter of America\u2019s Opioid crisis. In 1992, after lobbying efforts by the members of PPP, Mayor Ed Rendell issued an Executive Order (4-92), legalizing the possession of syringes in Philadelphia. The reasoning behind the executive order was to help control the spread of HIV/AIDS &amp; &nbsp;Hepatitis. Addicts are permitted to obtain a bag of drug paraphernalia which contains; &nbsp;cotton swabs, crack pipes, needles and much more. These items are supposed to be returned to the center from where they picked it up, in order for them to receive another sterile bag of drug paraphernalia. Unfortunately, the reality is, a high number of the items distributed are not collected nor discarded properly by the center if at all. The addict population whom, the majority of, are not residents, leave paraphernalia all over the neighborhood. Public parks, playgrounds, private property, store fronts, which are all plagued by used needles to the point where children can not play safely and many mothers are forced to make the decision of whether or not to even allow their children to wear open toe shoes through the neighborhood; due to fear of their child being poked by a syringe. Tragically, there have been one too many cases where children are forced to get medical treatment not only for the needle stick injury, but also, emergency medication called Trivacy and Truveda within 24 hours of the incident. This to be followed by multiple visits, lab work and in severe instances, treatment for the stress and anxiety that accompanies this type of traumatic experience. The medication itself totals over $2000 in out of pocket expenses. How can residents already living below the poverty level afford this required medical treatment? Why are residents forced to pick up used drug paraphernalia that an organization gets paid to distribute and properly dispose of. During one clean up event The Kensington Beach organization collected a total 873 used needles in McPherson Park which holds the community\u2019s only local library. No children should be subjected to these living conditions. Please join us in signing the petition to enforce Pennsylvania State Law in Philadelphia to stop the needle exchange program.

A police report has been made, but no action has been taken; it is not the first altercation she has been involved with on our apartments and won\u2019t be the last! She has a criminal record and continues to get into altercations with neighbors. It will help my family be more safe and everyone here at our apartment complex! Now my nephew is traumatized and gets up scared, also my pregnant sister was present and it is not fair for them to have seen that! I don\u2019t want to go into another physical altercation with her if I do get assaulted again, since she is a minor; I would loose so much and go to jail for self defense, cops are not doing anything because she 16 years!

I spent my summer training a stellar 3 Year Old 17.2hh Thoroughbred x Morgan Gelding that blew the socks off any Warmblood I've ever ridden. It is so unfortunate that he will never be registered, unless presented to the American Warmblood Registry.&nbsp;Most \"Warmblood\" people unfortunately hardly recognize this Registry as legitimate. At the end of the Summer, I was so inspired by this cross, that I selected three off-track Thoroughbred mares that I brought home and bred to my Full Lippitt Morgan stallions.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThis is not the first cross though that I have encountered that took the breath away of passerbys, and were horses remembered for a lifetime by the people that owned them. Moriesian, Morab and Quarter Horse crosses are a few examples of the breeds who have been blessed by the blood of the Morgan. These horses were never accepted into any special showring-- even to compete among each other as what they were, all descendants of the breed we love dearly -- the Morgan Horse. This is something I would like to change.\n&nbsp;\nI believe that with an AMHA endorsed Part Morgan Registry, it would promote the Morgan to many outsiders of the breed. I believe this Registry could be operated much like the Arabian Horse Association operates its' Part Bred and Anglo-Arabian Registry. Special classes could be held, bringing higher turnout to shows. It would help the Morgan appeal to the ever growing Sporthorse market and help the breed grow and perpetuate for generations to come.\n&nbsp;\nIt may take time to develop, and get its' feet off the ground. I believe, given a fair chance though, that the AMHA will never turn back. Within my neighborhood in the small rural town of which I live, I know of six half Morgan offspring just waiting for the opportunity to join a Registered family of horses! This is not including neighboring towns, with numerous babies from non-Morgan mares our Morgan stallions bred by request of those in awe of his Morgan traits.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nFigure stamped the mares he was crossed on, it was what he was known for. This is how we have the Morgan we do today. Every Morgan we love and own descended from that very special horse owned&nbsp; by Justin Morgan himself. Are these beautiful half-bred Morgans any different? Are they not descendants as well of Figure? I believe they deserve their recognition as such; recognizing these horse will only help the breed grow and perpetuate. Allowing this Registry would prevent the adulteration of the pure Morgan ancestors to these crosses. People can have a Saddlebred type Morgan, a Warmblood type Morgan, a Quarter Horse type Morgan-- by having their crosses recognized and not changing the breed itself. Morgan horses across the globe continue to stamp their Morgan traits to this day.

This was not a case of a \u201cdesk rejection,\u201d where an editor decides that a book does not have academic merit or does not achieve the marketing goals of the press: Coup had received glowing peer reviews, and a publication contract with NUS Press had already been signed (on August 29, 2019). The book had been designed and was even available for pre-order online. Instead, what Mr. Schoppert related to Dr. Pavin was that \u201cstakeholders within and outside the university community\u201d had exerted their influence to cancel the book\u2019s publication. The decision was sudden, opaque, and out of keeping with good academic practices.\nThis is a clear violation of academic freedom. Academic presses base their decisions to publish or not on the academic merit of the works involved, and on the peer reviews that scholars in the field provide. Indeed, as a testament to Coup\u2019s merit, it was readily accepted and is now published by Yale Southeast Asia Studies. Academic presses should not be beholden to political pressure, either from within the university or from other actors. NUS Press has been in the past a valuable resource, especially for scholars in and of Southeast Asia. Its deference to unnamed \u201cstakeholders within and outside the university\u201d is disturbing to say the least and calls into question the reputation and independence of the Press.\nWe are calling for a moratorium on reviewing new manuscripts for NUS Press, for five years. This is for a number of reasons. We feel that a boycott of NUS Press books would only hurt the scholars who have in the past published with the Press. Additionally, NUS Press cannot reverse its decision on Coup; the book has a happy home now at Yale. But we cannot have faith in NUS Press\u2019s independence and commitment to academic freedom moving forward. It is a sad day indeed when a university press that has served the academic world so well acts so cravenly in response to anonymous pressure. It sets a dangerous precedent that the directors of other presses will have good reason to fear. We hope that NUS Press will carry out a public inquiry staffed by independent observers as the one way to reassure the academic world that it is interested in regaining its hitherto stellar reputation.

The current plan includes a 0.34 mile gap in pedestrian access which prevent safe passage of students to the schools.&nbsp;\nWhites Road, in Fort Mill, SC, is located between the Fort Mill Bypass and the Waterside at the Catawba neighborhood. It is home to the entrance to 2 area schools \u2013 Catawba Ridge High School and, as of fall 2020, Forest Creek Middle School. This road is 1 mile long. The middle school spans almost the entirety of the first 0.40 miles after the Dominion Bridge neighborhood. &nbsp;Then there is a 0.34 mile stretch of road with no margin for pedestrians. There is one private residence on this stretch of land, and the rest is land associated with the power lines. Next follows &nbsp;0.30 miles of side-walked road outside the neighborhoods of Pecan Ridge and Waterside at the Catawba.\nThere are hundreds of students that live in the neighborhoods off Whites Road \u2013 all are no more than 2 miles from the schools \u2013 easily bikeable and even walk friendly for many students. However, it is impossible to get to the schools due to the 0.34 miles stretch of road with no area for pedestrians. &nbsp;This forces our students take a bus or car to school. Traffic in the area is already a problem and inevitably will get worse with the opening of the new school. We want the option for students to walk to school \u2013 taking cars and buses off the road. This will also provide a safe roadway for sports teams to run on and area residents to exercise.\nWe understand that this road is a state road, and there is no transportation improvement funds to solve this problem. Thus, we are requesting pedestrian access between Forest Creek and the neighborhoods as part of the existing budget for Forest Creek Middle School. We request this to be completed by the opening of the school in fall 2020. We understand that the road is scheduled to be widened in the next decade and new sidewalks will be put in at that time; however, hundreds of students need to get to school now. Any money put toward a pedestrian walkway is not wasted. It is an investment in the traffic situation for our area, a reduction of cost in busing, and a step towards our community living a more active lifestyle.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/mn/zh/fdMNZHxXhUKorVh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605305852"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/target-stop-hartz-products-from-hurting-and-killing-dogs?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "STOP HARTZ PRODUCTS FROM KILLING AND INJURING OUR PETS!", "description": "Precious Jack died on New Years Eve 2020 just hours after a flea bath with this shampoo.

During the fiscal year 19/20, the M.e.t.'s educational outreach program taught over 181,000 children and adults about sustainability, composting, and curbside and drop-off recycling. The M.e.t. also operates 10 recycling centers in 8 member communities and employs 75 individuals with disabilities. These workers brighten the lives of all those who visit the recycling centers with their warm welcomes and smiles. The environmental services and education the M.e.t. provides are invaluable to Tulsa citizens and surrounding communities.\nThe Tulsa Authority for the Recovery of Energy (TARE) wishes to remove two of the Tulsa drop-off recycling centers and reduce funding for the M.e.t.'s educational outreach program. By removing the East Tulsa center (2160 S Garnett Rd, Tulsa, OK 74129) and the Downtown Tulsa center (1101 S Cincinnati Ave, Tulsa, OK 74119), the only available drop-off recycling center in the Tulsa area would be the Central Tulsa location off 34th and Sheridan. This would greatly impact Tulsa citizens access to recycling services. Keeping all three drop-off recycling centers open in Tulsa is important because:\n\nThe M.e.t. makes recycling accessible for apartment dwellers and those in multi-family housing. This population is not able to use the recycling services provided by the City.\nThe M.e.t. accepts materials that are not recyclable through Tulsa's curbside program, such as electronics, batteries, grocery bags, cooking oil, and motor oil.&nbsp;\nThe M.e.t. provides recycling services to a large and growing number of citizens in the East Tulsa and Downtown areas.\nThe M.e.t. produces educational materials for member governments, Tulsa area citizens, schools, and non-profits and also provides hands-on environmental education in classrooms and after-school programs.\n\nThe M.e.t. provides environmental services and education that the City of Tulsa does not have the capacity to fill. Citizens in the Downtown Tulsa and East Tulsa communities will be without reasonable access to recycling services if TARE removes the two drop-off recycling centers in these communities. Moreover, contamination rates in curbside programs will likely increase if citizens do not have easy access to centers where they are able to drop-off items that are not accepted in the curbside containers. This may cause less materials to be recycled because contaminated recycling will go to the landfill. Reducing funding for educational programming will also negatively impact the M.e.t.'s ability to promote environmental stewardship and provide children and adults with high quality environmental education.\nPlease consider signing this petition and contacting your city council member and/or the TARE board to express your support for the M.e.t. and keeping Tulsa green!\nTARE contact:&nbsp;\nJenna EvansTARE Secretary2445 S.

A threat exists today that would demolish the original Little Singer School (est. 1976) in Birdsprings, Arizona on the Navajo Nation. This first of its kind school was the dream of Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed (Little Singer), a powerful Din\u00e9 medicine man, and was the design of Thomas Ryan Sr., a physicist from northern California. The dream was to halt the forced removal of Dine children to far off residential schools.\nMy family and I are originally from Birdsprings, Arizona, and our maternal clan is T\u00f3d\u00edch\u2019\u00ed\u00ednii. We come to you today to humbly ask for your help in saving the original Little Singer School in Birdsprings, Arizona on the Navajo Nation. The name of the school carries the legacy of Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed, Little Singer, who is remembered for his knowledge of Din\u00e9 ceremonies, prayer songs, wisdom, generosity, and kindness. Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed\u2019s innovative thinking, especially with regards to the welfare of the Birdsprings community allowed for his vision for the betterment of his people.&nbsp;\nIn 1970 he befriended my stepfather, Thomas Ryan Sr.,&nbsp; who was living at Rincon Ranch in Winslow, Arizona. Although Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed only spoke Navajo and Ryan only spoke English, they often visited and conversed and soon a friendship blossomed. It was Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed\u2019s concern for the future of his people that led to the vision of building a school \u201cto bring the children home.\u201d Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed was aware of an unnatural deafening silence due to the absence of children in Birdsprings. Ryan learned from his Navajo friends that the U.S. Federal Government\u2019s Indian education policy was to separate children from their families for nine months out of the year to attend Federal Indian Boarding Schools. Therefore, he wholeheartedly accepted Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed\u2019s request to build a community school, where the curriculum would incorporate the Din\u00e9 language and culture.&nbsp;\nBeginning in the early 1970\u2019s Thomas Ryan Sr. designed the iconic red geodesic domes and an \u201cA-frame\u201d building that comprised the original school. The geodesic shape was built for strength and longevity, as well as, to mimic the form of the traditional Navajo hogan. Since no electrical lines existed in Birdsprings at the time, two wind generators provided the electricity for the school; and solar panels harnessed the sun\u2019s energy to heat the school. Through prayers offered by Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed, the steadfast efforts of the Birdsprings community, and Ryan\u2019s ingenuity, the Little Singer School opened in 1979. It was the first sustainable school on the Navajo Reservation. The education received at Hataa\u0142\u00ed Y\u00e1zh\u00ed Bi\u2019O\u0142ta, Little Singer School, enabled one to read and write in the Din\u00e9 language, to sing social and prayer songs in Navajo, and to learn about the Din\u00e9 culture and history from elders.&nbsp;\nAlthough my family and I are happy that a new school is built, we do not want the original school to be demolished.

This piece of proposed legislation, introduced by State Rep. Wes Allen (R), seeks to prohibit medications that block or delay puberty for transgender individuals aged 18 years and younger whose gender assigned at birth is incongruent with their experienced gender. As transgender (trans) individuals and parents of trans youth who have experienced the medically recognized condition known as gender dysphoria from an early age, we speak on this matter as experts. We have first-hand knowledge of the challenges that a trans individual faces when they are forced to transition later in life due to not having access to medications prescribed by medical professionals who specialize in trans care. Having access to both mental health professionals as well as physicians whose therapies can delay the onset of puberty allows trans youth to receive ongoing counseling and the ability to seek and examine the individual they authentically are. Such services may be defined as nothing short of lifesaving. The services and pharmaceuticals that are the subject of this misguided bill merely pause the onset of a dysphoria-inducing puberty in order for a young trans person to make personal decisions with the support from&nbsp;parent/guardian and supervised by medical and mental health professionals.\nWe do not stand alone in our opposition to VCCPA. Our position is shared in whole or in part by the American Pediatrics Association, the American Medical Association, ACLU and many others (including more than 200 medical professionals who signed an open letter last year opposing these type of bills here in the south and nationwide). The population of trans youth already face a multitude of challenges, not least among which are numerous health disparities. Young people who identify as transgender or gender diverse (TGD) would be irreparably and permanently harmed by the VCCPA. It is devoid of either the \u201ccompassion\u201d or \u201cprotection\u201d its title purports to espouse; instead,&nbsp; it will irreparably infringe upon the rights of transgender youth and that of their families to seek specialized treatment and care as described and endorsed by the American Pediatrics Association and other medical groups.&nbsp;\nTrans youth, as well as the trans community as a whole, continue to face disparities that stem from multiple sources, including inequitable laws and policies, societal discrimination, and a lack of access to consistent, quality healthcare. This is equally or even more intense for trans youth who do not conform to social expectations and norms regarding gender. The best estimates suggest that nearly 1.4 million adults in just the United States identify as transgender or gender non-conforming and that almost 2% of youth ages 13-18 personally identify as transgender. In Alabama there are approximately 1.67 million high school age young people. Statistics indicate that some 33,000 of them may identify as transgender. These trans youth consistently face extremely high rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, non-lethal self-harm, and suicide. We find 56% of youth who identify as transgender reported previous suicidal ideation and&nbsp;31% report previous suicide attempts. In Alabama this would equate to 11,000 of our children. Blocking, limiting or forbidding legal access to trans care for youth will almost certainly&nbsp;increase the risk of harm to general public health and safety. Passage and implementation of this legislation will inexorably lead to the exact opposite of its stated intent as the numbers of trans youth who seek to become who they choose to be are once again told they do not have access to the medical treatments they want and desperately need and therefore resort to less safe approaches to therapy.\nLegislation like the VCCPA bubbles to the surface propelled by antiquated, hysterical anti-trans myths, misconceptions and outright bigotry. One such myth is the inexplicable and un-supported claim that there are people who actively seek to perform surgeries on underage trans teens (including but not limited to gender reassignment). Nothing could be further from the truth. Gender Confirmation Surgery (GCS) is a&nbsp; momentous, consequential procedure and a decision no more appropriate for youths as the process involves an extended period on hormonal replacement therapy (years) and an extended series of counseling sessions by a mental health professional who works with the individual, also usually for many years, before making a decision to proceed with any type of surgeries as an adult. Even as an adult, professional certification of stable mental health, as well as medical health most often is required in order to undergo these types of procedures. Rep. Allen and others who support this type of discriminatory legislation appear to labor under the mind-boggling misconception there is a hidden agenda or secret national movement to promote gender reassignment surgeries in youth and that the medications that aide youth in making life choices, as guided by parents and mental health professionals, are harmful and damaging to their bodies. This is a baseless assertion supported by absolutely no evidence. It is not only non-factual, but ahistorical and un-scientific. In fact, these treatments seek to stabilize the trans youth and provide an alternative to the agonizing 56%&nbsp;of suicidal ideations and the 31% of actual suicidal attempts. How is it \u201ccompassionate\u201d to enact legislation that will certainly immiserate a fragile, marginalized community? The short answer is that is not. Trans people, our youth included, are among the most hated and despised in our nation, and doubtless so in our state and this benighted bill is yet another manifestation of that hatred. Trans youth simply want what any other citizen of the United States and specifically citizens of the Great State of Alabama want: access to quality healthcare and to live freely and authentically.&nbsp;\u201cWe Dare Defend Our Rights\u201d applies equally to our trans siblings wherever in Alabama they may be.\nWe are at a time in our nation in which we see systemic racism, anti-semitism, separatism, and a general breakdown of our society as a whole, both politically and morally. None of this is the fault of the trans community, young or old. We urge you to reject out-of-hand as harmful and hurtful the provisions of the VCCPA by voting it down. In doing so you will take a stand for the thousands of youth of our State and many other States who already face multifarious discriminations for simply living their lives. Their discrimination must not be endorsed and advanced by their elected representatives. Individual rights are the essential foundation of our democracy. Too often we see government over-reach their mandate, telling others how to live,&nbsp;worship, or exist. Let us not allow H.B. 303 to put our state again on the wrong side of history. We implore you to reject the VCCPA.\nPlease join us in giving these youth a voice. One that says, yes we are different, yes we are non-conforming, but are we not also equal in the eyes of the law as any other youth that would seek other types of medical treatments? We are also creative, community oriented, talented and well educated members of society that deserve to have our government recognize us as more than second class citizens. It was Martin Luther King Jr. who reminded us that&nbsp;\u201cIt may well be that we will have to repent in this generation. Not merely for the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around and say, \"Wait on time.\u201d In summation trans kids have the same rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as any other American citizen.\nWe thank you for your time and consideration in&nbsp;this matter and we make&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;continuously available to present any materials or answer any questions, including directly from transgender youth in our Alabama community and many from around the country who stand to join us in these&nbsp;efforts in discharging&nbsp;discriminatory legislation as the VCCP Act before you now.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/gs/cl/bKgsclcDRShwXju-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610497233"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/j-b-pritzker-reduce-sentence-for-man-excessively-sentenced-as-a-teenager?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Reduce Sentence for Man Excessively Sentenced as a Teenager", "description": "At age 19, Michael Hill was sentenced excessively for 3rd degree murder- despite acting out of self defense.

The dance depicts police brutality against Black people through movement and projected text that said \u201cEvery human should have the right to\u2026\u201d followed by some of the reasons Black people have been the targets of police violence including \u201csleep peacefully\u201d, and \u201csurvive a traffic violation.\u201d\nOn Thursday, December 10th, the Dean of the College of Fine Arts and Production told the director of the dance department that the projected text had to be removed from the piece. Although disappointed and angry, we agreed to perform the piece without the projector.\nOn Friday, December 11th, the opening night of our concert, we were told that an entire section of the dance where dancers fell to the ground to depict the loss of Black lives had to be removed as well.&nbsp;\nAfter hearing this news, the cast of the piece met to organize a peaceful protest where instead of performing the censored version of the dance, we stood on stage as the music played while holding signs that said what the projected text was going to say.

She was run over by him more than once and in front of her two young children, 8 and 9 years old, as well as our father, Charles. Her murder was horrific. My family could not even view her, as she was completely crushed in the incident. Robert Mentz is fighting his case, by saying he accidentally ran her over, when the damage to her body tells a more devastating tale. Homicide detectives have dropped the ball dramatically, by not handling her case in a more serious manner. They have failed to reach out to us when promised, and even the DA on my sister's case has attempted to get them to reach out to us. As we have requested her belongings and some reason to the lesser charges and incident details that they seem to have left out, as her children and our father are victims to this vicious attack against, Robert Mentz. We just got word yesterday, 1/13/20, that Robert Mentz attorney is requesting a new judge to hear his case, in an attempt to be released until trial. My family is terrified! Robert Mentz is a know Domestic abuser and even fled Colorado, due to open Domestic Violence and child endangerment charges, as well as having an open restraining order issued in the state from a previous girlfriend. He knows where we live. He is a dangerous man and will do this again if he is given the opportunity. Not only does my sister Brandi Garcia deserve justice, her children and our family deserve to feel safe as well, as our lives, especially the children, have been forever changed. Rovert Mentz is a monster who has proven time and again that he is a dangerous man. Our community will not be safe if Robert Mentz is released! Please be a voice in this cause.

Virtual learning is just not possible for students of a young age, students with disabilities and students with difficult home situations.\nUnfortunately each school district interprets the guidelines from the State Department of Health very differently.&nbsp; They may base this on their own staffing needs and their inability to comprehend medical data and or epidemiology, as they are not medical professionals. They are also highly biased due to their Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThis has resulted in huge disparities in education. The Governor and DOE have offered very little direction. Currently, most special needs children have been relegated to sitting on a chrome book for five minutes per day, as that is all their attention span will allow. This is the second year for them where everything they look forward to has been canceled.\nThe special-ed teachers can draft lofty assignments all day long, but without help from therapists, teachers, parents and grandparents at home they will never be accomplished.\nMy son has a team of therapists including OT, PT and Speech. How can I ever re-create what 3 or 4 professionals can do on a daily basis. I have my Masters Degree but it is regrettably in another field. I would not expect any of those professionals to come to my work place and save a life.\n&nbsp;The idea that I can fulfill the duties of five other professionals while having a career and caring for my family is ludicrous.\nLogging into a Chrome book for five or ten minutes daily does not prove socialization, or stimulation. Virtual learning is a poor substitution for a full six hour school day.\nLet us have access to Special Ed teachers or assistants that can come to our home to assist. Let us have access to private schools that are actually open.&nbsp;\nDo not allow the disadvantaged and struggling students among us to fall even further behind due to this bureaucratic struggle we now find ourselves in.&nbsp;\nI do not wish for more people to fall ill with the COVID virus. But there are other social and human rights issues that also ail us. These unprecedented times are representing an unfair access to education. This is the the clearest discrimination, I have ever seen.&nbsp;\nChildren with IEP's in place are not getting any sort of learning. Schools \"shut down\" and \"quarantine\" every few minutes due to perceived exposures.&nbsp;\nAnd in the end, we will have lost a generation of young minds. Will the hands of time turn back?\nWe must do better for our childrens self esteem and well being. Virtual learning is clearly impossible. Life is an in-person activity my friends.

Grinups, a long-time PE teacher, launched the first Girls Fitness class in Fairfax County which prompted numerous other schools in the county to follow suit.&nbsp;\nOver the past decade, Girls Fitness has gotten increasingly popular with the class having an extensive waitlist every year. Last year, this prompted Grinups to solely teach Girls Fitness in order to better accommodate the class\u2019 interest. Girls Fitness has between 3-4 sections with Grinups teaching between 80 to 100 girls.&nbsp;\nGrinups has been praised for the work she has done to uplift her girls, create unity amongst them, instill healthier lifestyle choices, and be a trusted adult for them to lean on. One of the core messages of the class is self-confidence and self-esteem. Through activities such as meditation, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, self-defense, bodyweights, dance, zumba, introduction into lifting, gratuity logs, and more, these young women are allowed to express and explore themselves in a safe, judgment-free space. For the past 8 years, Grinups\u2019 efforts have been rewarded by the Community Foundation of Northern Virginia (CFNV). CFNV has given grants which Grinups has used to provide new athletic shoes for every girl in the class.&nbsp;\nThe reason given by the Westfield Administration for discontinuing Girls Fitness is \u201cWestfield cannot have a gender-specific class.\" In order for the class to continue there have been proposed solutions by the school such as a ''neutral'' name change such as \u201cFitness\u201d and allowing the class to be open to male students. This would completely hinder and void the focal purpose of Girls Fitness. Most of the young women who sign up for the class are either intimidated or simply do not want the pressure of having their male peer\u2019s presence and or judgment.&nbsp;\nPersonal Fitness, a weight training class, is offered at Westfield and open to both genders. As girls are progressively feeling more comfortable joining the male-dominant class, they too are predominately athletes like the overwhelming majority of guys in the class. Girls Fitness shows these girls who are not viewed as typical \u201cathletes\u201d that they are in a space full of other girls who are on the same health journey. To be a female especially in this era of social media is brutal and tough. People are not accepting of those who don\u2019t fit a ridiculous \u201cbeauty standard\u201d seen online and high school is certainly no exception.&nbsp;\nFor Westfield to preach inclusion and the motto- \u201cEach One, Reach One, Teach One\u201d but is taking away a trailblazing class such as Girls Fitness is unacceptable. Westfield Admin claims if this was an \u201call boys choir\u201d or \u201call girls STEM club\u201d they would have faced the same issue. This is not the workforce where there are companies and organizations with clear and prevalent gender inequalities and racial discrimination who claim otherwise. This is a class at a high school that is giving young women an opportunity to again become an even better version of themselves. There is so much that can be learned from individuals who are of the same gender, race, ethnicity, or interest all united by a common goal. I am not advocating just for Girls Fitness but for all the other clubs, classes, and groups male and female that are similarly formatted who are spreading positivity and uplifting its members for honest, sincere reasons like Grinups.\nAs a close, former PE student of Grinups, I know the heart and passion she has for Girls Fitness class. Being able to sit in interest meetings at the electives fair and see the confidence and joy that radiates off her students is truly amazing. There is not much time before students get to choose their classes and before their schedules are finalized in June, so I am asking all of you to sign this petition and email Westfield Administration to show them that Girls Fitness is not just another class they can discontinue.

To my mind, the most basic aspect of securing a happy, fulfilling and successful life starts at home.\nAs Keith\u2019s fianc\u00e9, I imagined being able to prepare and eat meals together, providing physical nourishment and growth; being able to share thoughts and ideas at the beginning and end of our days, providing mental nourishment and growth; and being able to care, pray and dream together, providing spiritual nourishment and growth, sooner rather than later.\nAnd what about my son? Why must he be deprived of a mentor, a male with principles and a man of faith who represents resilience, gratitude and the reason for second chances? My son is away at college in Santa Barbara, and while he may come home infrequently, how can he develop a relationship with the man he will call \u2018step-father\u2019 if he is deprived access to him? This also deprives Keith of the opportunity to develop those tools that will be so necessary when he begins to reestablish his relationships with his own estranged sons.\nI don\u2019t see how the BOP can claim to support the people in their care and truly wish for their success, if they hinder one of the most important tenets of a successful return- the building and maintaining of family ties.\nHere\u2019s another point. Keith has employment and after May 2021 has no federal supervision- and he is sober. So why at the end of a long, productive day must he go back to you, while I am at home alone? Keith and I are both left without the benefit of the other. This can\u2019t be what the BOP intends when they speak of rehabilitation and successful reentry, is it?\nLastly, do I really need to mention the health consequences of having Keith go back and forth between a congregate setting and work during this Covid-19 pandemic? We work in the same place, along with two elderly people in their eighties. And now it\u2019s come to my attention that you have released 18,000 people to home confinement. Is there a reason you\u2019ve singled out my fianc\u00e9 for denial?\nI ask that you grant him home confinement without delay,\nRespectfully, Tracy Brown\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/ps/zs/sqPsZSNejnJFjGI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609788311"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/cumberland-county-school-board-schools-to-reopen?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Schools to reopen", "description": "Cumberland County School Board has ignored the voice of many parents and teachers by refusing to reopen schools.

The emotional animal support team take a long time to process a student's request to allow their pets in their dorm. A lot of times, students do not even have a note from a doctor to allow them to have an emotional animal support. Not everyone is in condition to go to a doctor for their mental health.

Monuments 20 years old a d younger can still be removed by the county or city they reside in because a monument 20 years old or younger is not a historical monument.

If you support this petition, please note why you do in your remarks. It is optional but very helpful to us. Thanks!)\nIn the autumn of 2020, it was announced that the BYUtv show Dwight in Shining Armor had just finished filming its last season - season 5. The show debuted in March 2019. By the time the show is complete, it will only have been on the air a little over 2 years. Each season was only 10 episodes of 30 minutes length. That comes out to only 25 hours total for the entire show. This just seems too short. We thought the show was doing well.&nbsp; For those interested in family comedy mixed with fantasy, you will love this show (if you have not seen it yet).&nbsp; Even we were surprised by how much we enjoyed it. Many people stream it online via BYUtv or the BYUtv streaming app.&nbsp;\nThe show is silly enough to attract kids from all age groups while still being intelligent enough for adults. The characters are all well acted and the writing is great. You actually do find yourself LOLing. We personally feel there is plenty more material to be explored in the show. We were really surprised to hear it was ending. We hope that BYUtv will reconsider it's decision. It's hard to find quality family television these days and Dwight in Shining Armor is a great addition. BYUtv, please change your mind on this issue and continue with this wonderful, imaginative series.

They are shoved and crammed by the numbers into too-small cages. They suffer from broken bones, dehydration and wounds from anxiously biting one another during transport to their place of execution. They are fed cannibalistic slop composed of the scraps and remains of those already killed.\nIn communal \u201cwet markets\u201d they are blow-torched, skinned, boiled and limbs cut off whilst still alive! They are bludgeoned to death or strung up and strangled in front of the others who await their turn. Dogs and cats are tortured, maimed and killed in such barbaric ways because connoisseurs believe that the animals' fear and adrenaline produces \u201ctastier meat\u201d. Human males in regions of SE Asia also have the nonsensical, superstitious belief that eating the meat increases their sexual prowess. Another falsehood is the notion that people depend on dog and cat meat for survival. This is simply not true. Dog and cat meat is actually more expensive on the menus in these countries than livestock animals, and is considered to be a \u201cspecial treat\u201d or delicacy.\nMillions of dogs and cats are killed for human consumption each year across SE Asia and several other regions of the globe. The most notable countries participating in the DCMT are as follows: China, North Korea, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Burma, India, Tonga, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Switzerland, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThis inhumanity and total negligence toward world health must not be allowed to continue! This is a continual holocaust of the world's most beloved animals. Dogs and cats have been domesticated and have lived with and graced humankind with love and companionship for thousands of years. To reiterate-the hazardously unhygienic means by which these animals are captured, bred, transported and butchered alive in public areas threatens us with yet another deadly outbreak! The U.S. must impose sanctions on the above-mentioned countries. We need to send the message loud and clear that such extreme animal cruelty will not be ignored and condoned, and that we will not allow another deadly pandemic to ravage the planet!

China, which has one of the most powerful militaries in the world, only spent $178.6 billion dollars in 2020.\nFurthermore, the government has spent $146 billion dollars in supporting Israel since 1948. Most of the money is used for military assistance. Since the year 2000, 2,120 Palestinian children have been killed by American funded Israeli weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIn March of 2020, Gallup poll asked Americans if they felt that the military budget was too much. 31% of those who answered believed that it was too much. The Pew Research Center asked American adults if they were favorable of the Israeli government. According to the Pew Research Center, only 28% of adults were favorable of the Israeli government.&nbsp;\nIf American citizens are promised the freedom to practice their beliefs, they should be promised the choice to allocate their tax dollars. Especially when the use of their tax money can violate their moral and ethical beliefs.&nbsp;\nBesides the United States\u2019 practice of freedom of beliefs, it is very clear that the American people are in need of a better education. According to Stanford University\u2019s News, each Californian student needs $17,000, but is only granted $12,000. The Conversation is an independent news organization that is funded by many universities across the United States. Regarding the 2017-2018 school year, they say that the federal government\u2019s use of $55 billion dollars towards K-12 education is \u201cjust 8% of the total $720 billion it costs to run the nation\u2019s public schools\u201d. The peer-reviewed scientific journal, Education and Lifetime Earnings in the United States, shows a correlation between greater education and greater income. Thus, it is especially important that taxpayers have the choice to or not to allocate more of their taxpayer money to solving important social issues like the United States\u2019 weak education system instead of the U.S.\u2019s military budget. This is just one example in which tax choice theory can be implemented. If allowed, tax choice theory can also be applied to funding towards prisons, police departments, social security etc.\nMoney is the most powerful resource the United States has. If the United States is truly a democratic nation, it would give its citizens the right to choose how their money is spent at the state/local level. To ensure that we have a balanced use of tax dollars, a certain percentage of tax money can be allocated to each department\u2019s needs by California State Legislature and the rest can be chosen by Californians. We declared independence in 1776 after being taxed without consent, thus it is our right as American citizens to choose how our tax money is being used. The Declaration of Independence states that \u201cwhenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government\u201d. Thus, I propose that we alter the way our government taxes its citizens, in hopes for a future that betters our American democracy and quality of life.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/9/cm/ra/ZwcmRAoHFPpbDjA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609464898"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/community-of-silver-city-start-a-disc-golf-course-in-silver-city?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Start a disc golf course in Silver City, NM", "description": "Have you ever spent a beautiful sunny afternoon strolling through the park playing fetch with yourself?

For example, it permits physicians affiliated with the Veterans Administration for the first time to make medical cannabis recommendations to qualifying veterans who reside in legal states, and it incentivizes states to move ahead with expungement policies that will end the stigma and lost opportunities suffered by those with past, low-level cannabis convictions.&nbsp;\nIn addition, the MORE Act would also allow the Small Business Administration to support entrepreneurs and businesses as they seek to gain a foothold in this emerging industry.

This Board was established to investigate allegations of misconduct by Metro Nashville Police officers, issue policy advisory and resolution reports by assessing allegations of misconduct, and to create a monitoring program that provides an ongoing review or audit of the complaint process administered by the MNPD.\nAnyone with a cell phone or television has felt the traumatic blow of seeing the murder of George Floyd, the assault of Jacob Blake, and countless other cases of misconduct by Law Enforcement. I dare say, what hurt more than seeing those videos was knowing there was bound to be a miscarriage of justice. I do not want to live in a community where tolerance for this behavior and lack of accountability exist.\nHaving a Community Oversight Board with members from diverse backgrounds will inevitably lead to more just outcomes.

The concern throughout the globe is the government\u2019s inability to implement and uphold the necessary measures to protect the lives of educators, students, and their families. This lack of protection has led to countless and entirely preventable deaths throughout the school system.\nTo fight against this demand, high school American Government and Economics teacher, Alfred \"Shivy\" Brooks of Atlanta Georgia, supported by educators across the nation, 100+ celebrities, teachers unions, and community leaders, is hosting \"National Day Without Teachers\" sick-out on Tuesday, December 15th, where teachers will not be logging into virtual learning or attending in-person classes. Shivy has been teaching his Clayton County students virtually, but he has been mandated to return in-person to proctor standardized testing, even with three of his students currently testing positive for COVID-19.\nThis isn't Shivy's story alone: this is the reality for thousands of teachers across the country.&nbsp;Teachers for Good Trouble are educators focused on reforming schools to build safe, nurturing, and justice driven school communities by eliminating standardized testing as a tool to measure performance during a pandemic.\nWe have a three-tiered approach in our demand for our school communities. First and foremost, we seek immediate reformation of the current state assessment process, including no standardized testing during the pandemic. Secondly, we demand that the physical, mental, and emotional health of our school communities be the driving force behind all system-wide policy decisions. Finally, we demand full transparency and inclusion regarding all fiscal, academic, and health-related policy developments.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/gk/wk/ztGkwKcnLroXURs-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606247043"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-rush-to-zoning-changes-for-miracle-mile-crafts-section-sign-a-petition-to-mayor-and-commissioners-to-postpone-its-decision?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "STOP THE RUSH TO ZONING CHANGES FOR MIRACLE MILE &amp; CRAFTS SECTION.", "description": "TO ALL CORAL GABLES RESIDENTS:\nREQUEST THAT CITY COMMISSIONERS POSTPONE VOTING on Miracle Mile and Crafts Section zoning changes. &nbsp;\nThe Historic Preservation Association of Coral Gables is requesting that the Miracle Mile remote parking and Crafts Section zoning&nbsp;changes to be heard at the Commission Meeting scheduled for February 9, 2021 be temporarily&nbsp;postponed until such time that public&nbsp;in-person&nbsp;attendance is possible at the Commission Meeting.\nOn February 9, 2021, the Coral Gables Commission will hold a meeting to vote on a number of changes to the zoning code, including allowing developers to utilize remote parking in determining building height.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThese changes would allow developers to transform historic Miracle Mile by building up to 7 stories, an unprecedented change in its 100-year history.&nbsp;\nSAY NO TO A SECOND READING VOTE ON FEBRUARY 9TH.\nClick below to read the recent article in Gables Insider for more details:\nhttps://gablesinsider.com/opinion-has-the-city-beautiful-gone-over-to-the-dark-side/", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/9/ay/dk/paAyDKSpPpNcChu-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610325126"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/episd-athletic-department-necessary-upgrades-needed-at-h-r-moye-gymnasium?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Necessary upgrades needed at H\u200b.\u200bR Moye Gymnasium", "description": "To whom it may concern,We are the \"Viva La Jeff\" social media team and we are starting a petition to bringawareness to the Athletic department and the El Paso Independent District that the H.R.Moye gymnasium at Jefferson High School is in need of major renovations. After severalconcerns and observations that have been brought to our attention we feel the need tospeak up and hopefully come to a resolution. We believe that these issues are a matter ofsafety for the students, parents, and staff of Jefferson High School and Silva Health Magnet.Please allow us to further explain;1. New bleachers.a. The current bleachers at the H.R. Moye gymnasium are the original bleachersthat were implemented when the gymnasium was built. This means they arealmost 50-years-old and it takes a minimum of 8 staff members to set up thebleachers and to push them back in which can result in time being taken awayfrom the custodial staff that could be used for other important duties aroundcampus.b. The current bleachers, as stated before, are outdated and therefore potentiallya danger to the students, parents, and staff's safety. There have been incidentsbrought to us where staff members have been close to being injured whilesetting up the bleachers for games, pep-rallys, etc. These bleachers also appearto be unstable and tend to shift while they are being utilized.2. Modern sound acoustics.a. The sound acoustics that the H.R. Moye gymnasium currently has are alsoalmost 50-years-old and therefore outdated. They are currently hanging fromthe center of the gymnasiums roof and are visible to the spectators that enterthe gymnasium.b. The sound acoustics are extremely difficult to reach and this makes themdifficult to clean and maintain by the staff. We also believe that these soundacoustics should be thoroughly inspected as they are old and may containtoxic materials, this is our biggest concern as this could affect the health ofstudents and staff.We are a team that is dedicated to improving and maintaining the integrity of the community andraising school spirit. We deeply care about the well-being of the students and staff at Jefferson HighSchool and Silva Health Magnet and about improving the campus and community surrounding itin numerous ways.

The company is currently under a court injunction prohibiting it from operating due to flagrant and dangerous activity at its former Cully site. Among other concerns, the facility in Cully was the site of a massive fire in 2018 that destroyed a&nbsp;duplex and two small homes, displacing several families, and blanketing the neighborhood in toxic black smoke for days. In addition, local schools were evacuated and many family pets were killed or had to be rescued.\nThe court order stipulates that the company may not begin operating until it obtains an air permit from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. The state has commenced proceedings to issue a permit, though extended the public comment period to February 2021, because of significant concern from the community. &nbsp;We demand that DEQ refuse to issue a permit to this polluter given the following&nbsp;factors:&nbsp;\n\nThe operator of this business has a long history of creating significant risk to neighbors and the environment by&nbsp;flouting &nbsp;environmental regulations.&nbsp;NW Metals was cited for nine violations of environmental law including improper hazardous waste and tire storage, Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act violations in association with the fire. The operator installed and was operating a&nbsp;vehicle shredder without notifying or seeking a permit from the state. In addition, this facility has been the focus of numerous unaddressed water quality issues.&nbsp;\nThe operator has outstanding unpaid penalties and a history&nbsp;of acting in bad faith. After enforcement action by DEQ, no payment has been made toward the $77,419 in penalties owed. The operator did not complete required cleanup activities or action to ensure compliance&nbsp;with environmental laws on schedule. DEQ was forced to obtain a&nbsp;Temporary Restraining Order and threaten the operator with jail time in order to compel NW Metals to perform cleanup and apply for a permit for the&nbsp;vehicle shredder prior to continuing to operate. The operator continued to operate the shredder illegally until March 4, 2020, recklessly disregarding both environmental regulations and public health.&nbsp;\nThis facility will put vulnerable people at greater risk. This new NW Metals site would be operating adjacent to Sitton Elementary, a Title I school, that serves a low income and BIPOC population, as well as George Middle School. Children are especially sensitive receptors to air pollution. The site is also near Chimney Park, a popular location for community recreation, as well as apartments that house more than two thousand of St. John's lower income residents. BIPOC and low income communities are already disproportionately impacted by poor air quality, especially diesel pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multnomah County Department of Health conducted a 2014 study of racial and ethnic health disparities and found that communities of color are exposed to levels of diesel pollution 2-3 times higher than their white counterparts. Thirty-six percent of residents of the area are BIPOC. Columbia Boulevard is already inundated with many indirect sources of pollution from traffic, trains and industry. Adding another source of pollution to this cumulative impact will result in significant harm to community health.&nbsp;\n", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/9/mn/nr/beMNnRYjtZnVQsb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608765581"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/edina-residents-put-edina-school-district-children-back-in-school-all-grades-five-days-a-week?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Get Edina School District Children back in School.

I am requesting everyone\u2019s support for enacting a change to 37 U.S.C. 476, Travel and transportation allowances: dependents; baggage and household effects.\nCurrently under 37 U.S.C. 476, military members are only authorized reimbursement of cost of quarantining pets in connection with a permanent change of station or if evacuating a location overseas. After reading the Joint Travel Regulations section 054103, I learned that civilian military employees are authorized reimbursement for transportation of pets whereas active duty personnel are not. Service members are required to pay out of pocket for the transportation of our pets to our new station.\nService members are required to travel overseas via aircraft contracted through Air Mobility Command (AMC). There are only a few pet spots on the plane. If you are unable to acquire a spot, you must procure your own plane tickets and pay for them yourself without reimbursement if you want your pets to fly with you. It cost my family $3,000 to bring my 3 dogs from Joint Base San Antonio Lackland to Ramstein Air Base, Germany. We have talked to other members who have paid over $10,000 to travel with their dogs. This high cost of shipping pets causes an undue burden to military members and their families during a time when stress is already highly elevated from moving. Many people consider pets part of the family and this results in service members being put in a tough spot where they must decide to spend thousands of dollars to bring them with or rehome the pets. If members are unable to pay this cost, they leave their pets with someone else, take out a loan, or take them to the local pet shelter. I worry that some of these pets will eventually be abandoned and become strays.\nRam\u00f3n Col\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez, Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has acknowledged this high cost of transporting pets in May 2020. He suggested they would look into and try to find a way to compensate the service members or come up with a mechanism to be able to take care of them. In October Rick Marsh, the Deputy Director of Strategic Plans, Policy and Logistics at U.S. Transportation Command was asked about any help coming to service members. He stated he didn\u2019t want to speculate on it. There has been zero indication of anything changing to help out service members.\nI am urging Congress to introduce a change to 37 U.S.C. 476 to allow for service members to be reimbursed for the expenses of moving pets in conjunction with a permanent change of station.

Over the years, the community has grown a reputation for being a location where all New York City residents are welcome. As you walk around you are greeted with bakeries and restaurants filled with food from all of the different parts of the globe. The 7 train rushes through the community, day to night as residents are working non-stop. The community truly contributes to New York\u2019s well-known reputation of being \u201cthe city that never sleeps.\u201d\nBehind the beauty of Corona, the challenges and struggles residents face on a day to day basis aren\u2019t invisible. Since 2010, the rent has continued to increase along with housing conditions for renters becoming nearly impossible to live in. Parents are sending their kids off to schools where less than half of students meet the English and Math grade level. Corona is a community that continues to face an increasing rate of preventable deaths along with a low rate of insured residents. Air pollution continues to be a recurring issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDuring this pandemic, Corona, Queens faces the highest rate of COVID-19 related deaths and infections than any community in NYC. Corona, along with Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, relied heavily upon Elmhurst hospital, which was already at 80% of its total capacity. The growing rates of infection and death in Corona brought about more struggles - food insecurity and unaffordable rent prices started becoming a reality for many residents. The youth living in Corona struggled with the transition to remote learning, as many don\u2019t have easy access to technology. Vendors and small businesses are struggling to last. Is this what Corona residents deserve?&nbsp;\nCurrently, Corona has no operating hospital for the residents of the community.\nThe closest hospital is in Elmhurst, where its supplies are overextended as rates of occupancy in Queens are at a soaring 280,000 people per hospital. This vulnerable and unheard community does not deserve to be treated this way and left to fend for themselves during these unprecedented times of hardship - it is the city\u2019s duty to help this ailing community.&nbsp;\nTo action:\n1. In order to help mitigate the healthcare issues currently affecting the neighborhood of Corona, Queens, the city of New York must evaluate which type of healthcare facility would be the most effective in the community, taking all factors into account (e.g. cost, public approval, projected utility, etc.) A medical facility is needed - it is the duty of the city and its government to determine which type of medical facility would be the most beneficial for the people of this neighborhood. These facilities would be at use of being accessible to the community.&nbsp;2. An idea without action is just a wish. It is no good to simply evaluate the type of medical facility that ought to be constructed in Corona, Queens - this facility must be constructed. It must not be constructed with the intention of building it for the sake of building it, rather, it must be built to last. It is the duty of the city to construct this medical facility with the intention of creating something that would last for years, providing a permanent solution to the healthcare issues the residents of Corona, Queens face.\n3.

According to data provided by CSUN\u2019s Office of Institutional Research, the current demographics of the tenure and tenure-track faculty is not representative of the student body. In 2020, the university employed 805 tenure and tenure-track faculty, and 56.9% of those individuals were White. Meanwhile, 68.2% of students identified as racial-ethnic minorities (e.g. Asian American, Latinx, African American). The disproportion is self-evident when you consider that there is 1 White faculty member for every 18 White students, compared to 1 Latinx faculty for every 233 Latinx students. The university is responsible for developing the minds of racial-ethnic minorities that will become leaders in our communities and cities. Without a complete opportunity to learn about our chosen fields from someone with a lived experience of what it means to be a racial-ethnic minority in the United States, we feel an extreme disservice is being done to racial-ethnic minority students, as well as racial majority students.

This is not a matter of political opinion, this is a matter of public safety. When students were found partying during a pandemic, UCONN, very quickly, condemned their actions and sent them home.

If they aren\u2019t going to give her the rights to her designs, they should at least give her back the rights to use her name and her social media accounts! #istandwithhayley #givehayleypaigehernameback", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/dk/qu/blDKquSgZelLTKh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608654575"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/support-alayna-other-asu-rape-victims?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Support Alayna &amp; other ASU rape victims", "description": "Form: Tell ASU administrators why we need a rape crisis center!\nWhen Arizona State University undergraduate Alayna reported being sexually assaulted on campus in February, ASU police delayed her rape kit, gaslit and silenced her, and administrators refused to stop harassing her when she requested they communicate through her lawyer while she recovered from COVID-19.\nAlayna was not expecting so many people to watch and share her videos when she posted about her experience on Instagram. She is grateful for the support and passionate about making sure other victims don\u2019t go through what she went through, so she\u2019s using her platform to advocate for rape crisis services ASU is lacking.\nASU currently has no rape crisis center, no women\u2019s center, and no rape crisis advocates not housed within the ASU Police Department.&nbsp;If Alayna had an actual rape crisis advocate instead of the ASU Police victim advocate, her experience reporting might not have been so devastating.\nIn addition to reimbursement for therapy and legal costs, Alayna is demanding that ASU invest in a rape crisis center and full time rape crisis advocates. Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault has been advocating for rape crisis services for the past few years.\nJoin Alayna and SDASA in demanding Arizona State University:\n\nCreate a rape crisis center as proposed by Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault and the ASU Women's Coalition, including hiring full time rape crisis advocates that are not part of ASUPD.\nReimburse Alayna for the cost of specialized trauma therapy.\nReimburse Alayna for legal fees incurred defending herself against ASUPD and the ASU administration\u2019s emotional abuse.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/di/oe/radIoEYTWLWrEfe-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605757113"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/the-national-assembly-of-armenia-save-armenia-stop-new-pashinyan-concessions?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "\u0553\u0550\u053f\u0535\u055b\u0546\u0554 \u0540\u0531\u0545\u0531\u054d\u054f\u0531\u0546\u0538\u2024\nSAVE ARMENIA\u2024", "description": "\u0553\u0580\u056f\u0565\u055b\u0576\u0584 \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0568, \u053f\u0561\u0576\u056d\u0565\u055b\u0576\u0584 \u0553\u0561\u0577\u056b\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0576\u0578\u0580 \u0566\u056b\u057b\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0568\n&nbsp;

These illegal and reckless actions by the Prime Minister \u2013 voluntarily ceding land defended by generations of Armenians \u2013 contradict the Armenian Constitution, compromise the security of the Armenian homeland, and threaten the very viability of the Armenian nation.The Prime Minister\u2019s unilateral actions \u2013 including those based upon \u201cverbal agreements\u201d he has reportedly undertaken but refuses to disclose \u2013 undermine Armenia\u2019s Parliamentary system, weaken the rule of law, disregard Artsakh\u2019s right to self-determination, and violate territorial integrity of both Artsakh and Armenia.

I experienced the downsides of the 90/10 grading system first-hand and how I had to completely change my approach to homework and school to be able to succeed in college. In high school, children should not be strictly graded on their ability to perform on assessments.&nbsp; The current grading system at Austin High School bases 90% of a student's final grade on their performances on their assessments. Leaving ONLY 10% for practice work. In order to do well on the assessments, it is imperative that students fully understand the concepts that are being presented to them. How is this possible if their practice work is only worth 10% of their final grade? The goal of practice work should be for ALL students to grasp the concepts and to be able to practice for the upcoming assessments. When the school is placing a minuscule percentage value on practice work in the final calculated grade of a student; what does that teach the student? It teaches them that practice work is not worth much and even optional. This lead to the downfall of many of my classmate's academic careers; in high school AND post-secondary education. In college, PRACTICE WORK AND ATTENDANCE MATTER. It is nearly impossible to switch from a 90/10 high-school academic mindset to a points-based collegiate academic mindset. Point-based grading provides a completely different learning environment and it promotes the development of self-responsibility and self-advocacy. It is necessary to teach children that in our society you have to do the practice work along the way to become successful at something. I believe 60% of a student's final grade based on their assessment scores is much more forgiving to the students who struggle with test-taking. This offers students 40% of their final grade to be based on the scores of their practice work. I think that it is important for students to get the opportunity to develop a hardworking and persistent attitude but with the current grading system that is difficult. Practice work should be a tool, it should be reasonable and not overdone. Many students have responsibilities outside of school and students are still children! For them to learn and comprehend the information they can't be burnt out. It is time we prioritize our children's mental health and prepare them for their futures. Lastly, there is no benefit to giving students homework every single day. The information they need to know can be completed with in-class practice work, in-class discussions, and group work. I have not had one of my college professors give homework every day. Students in high school need to be given the time they need to learn the skill of hard work and persistence. I believe that a change from the current 90/10 grading system to the 60/40 grading system could help them significantly. Prioritize the student's success, sign the petition for 60/40 grading system implementation at Austin High School.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/kx/sh/pfKxsHIHlGqPMWe-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610585100"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/john-clemenzi-demand-john-clemenzi-resign-from-the-wenham-board-of-selectmen?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Demand John Clemenzi Resign from the Wenham Board of Selectmen", "description": "John Clemenzi admitted to the behavior that led to a sexual harassment claim by a Town employee, and yet one year later he continues to hold office and litigation drags on as a second woman has come forward with her own experience.\nThe initial harassment claim came to public view only following a Freedom of Information Act filing and an order from the MA State Attorney General\u2019s office to the BoS to release Executive Session minutes that had been withheld from the public.&nbsp; The minutes indicate the possibility of&nbsp;a pattern of predatory behavior, an apparent breach of confidentiality in releasing the name of the victim, and possible acts of retaliation against the claimant and her family.&nbsp;\nThe two other Wenham Selectmen, Chairman Gary Cheeseman, and Selectman Jack Wilhelm, should act in the Town\u2019s best interest and urge John Clemenzi to step down.&nbsp;\nWe, the undersigned constituents of the Town of Wenham, condemn the behavior of Selectman Clemenzi and call on him to submit his resignation immediately from the Wenham Board of Selectmen.&nbsp;\nFor more info: HW Chronicle - Selectman named in Sexual Harassment Case\nThank you for taking the time to help make a better Wenham.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/km/bs/xPKMBSXzJiigaVx-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610541743"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/falynn-coles-me-save-the-sumatran-tigers?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Save the Sumatran Tigers", "description": "There is less than 400 Sumatran Tigers left in the world.

To hear news of USC and Berkley announce plans for students to be back in Fall 2021, Governor Newsome\u2019s order that teachers begin to be vaccinated and still be met with silence from our private university, who we know has the power to at least open campus for students to walk on is deeply frustrating and disheartening. If LA County has a problem with the opening of LMU\u2019s campus, it is valid to tell them that you are allowing students on campus, like many other California institutions, and it is being done safely because our raised tuition can be used to implement precautions and protocols to make our campus COVID safe. The concern over liability could be addressed through a liability waiver and strict screening protocols. We appreciate LMU\u2019s concern for student safety and understand it is a top priority, however, we do not believe LMU Administration is currently trying their best to make our tuition worth the cost.\nThis inaction from LMU comes with severe emotional consequences for students, especially seniors, who will never have the chance to enjoy our campus as a student again. Many students have been forced to drop out of school because facilities and equipment are unavailable. It is not safer to kick us off campus than provide a safe academic, supervised environment on campus. Students are meeting anyway, in places like houses, or PDO apartments to work on assigned projects, especially senior theses. For example, Theatre Arts students working towards their senior thesis have to look for outside theatres, equipment, and crews to film and perform the projects that they will create, instead of using our facilities that could be made safe and open to us.&nbsp;\nIt is especially disconcerting that with the closure of campus and its facilities our tuition has not been discounted, but raised. How can this be justified if we do not even have access to our gym, our theatre/film facilities, our library? And if tuition was raised under the guise of prepping our campus with sanitation supplies, for our guaranteed safety, that justification is null - as everyone, with the exemption of few students who live on campus, cannot even see the campus. How can this raise of tuition be justified, or a discount be unjustified, with no forthcoming plan to let us set foot onto our outdoor campus?&nbsp;\nIt is distressing to see that LMU\u2019s sports teams and student-athletes are able to access campus, and play their games on campus - yet the rest of us cannot even see our campus, but must still pay raised tuition! Theatre students need the theatre, film students need equipment, science students need their labs, dance students need their studios, just as much as athletes need their fields. It appears as though athlete students are being favored - and that is not only upsetting but discriminatory towards non-athlete students.&nbsp;Because of actions such as these, we do NOT feel respected or served as students who chose Loyola Marymount University for their college experience.&nbsp;\nIn lieu of the aforementioned, we demand that opening our campus to students, and facilities to senior students, should be strongly considered. Other institutions in California such as USC, Cal Poly, Chico State, and San Diego State were able to assemble a plan for students to have access to their campus, and successfully open in Fall 2020, so why can\u2019t LMU? Countless campuses across the nation, such as Princeton University and Fordham University, a private Jesuit institution like our own, with fully online classes have still given their students access to campus. We will no longer be complacent and sit at home while LMU raises our tuition but does not give us anything in return for that tuition increase. We realize there have been challenges in navigating this unprecedented situation, however, until these concerns are directly addressed we will continue to request more communication and clarity regarding a plan.\nHere are some suggestions for a potential plan that allows students on campus and seniors access to facilities:\n1.) It is required that students fill out a prescreening COVID survey and enter their student ID to guarantee to LMU security that we are students before being allowed on campus.&nbsp;2.) Have students sign a waiver that makes LMU not liable for contracting&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;COVID-19. Mandate masks and socially distant policies.&nbsp;3.) A possible limit of students who can be on campus each day. We have the capability to be considerate and moderate how often we go on campus. Also, since many students have gone home to take their online classes, the campus will not be faced with an unmanageable influx of students.&nbsp;4.) Use the money from our raised tuition to supply sanitation materials such as hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes around campus and increase cleaning of used spaces.&nbsp;\nWe send this message to you with so much love for LMU in our hearts. Many students must juggle jobs, credits/classes, senior theses, graduation, adjusting to a lack of social life, family health concerns, and stressed mental/emotional health and we believe that reopening campus can help ease our emotional burden if it can be done safely. We implore you to allow us to see the beautiful view off of the Bluff again, let us sit in the sunken gardens and read or work on our homework, and be able to enjoy our LMU experience on the campus that we call home. Our academic performance and mental health will greatly benefit. It can be done safely with diligence and a plan. Please, think of your students. Think of your seniors, who need closure to an already disrupted college experience. We implore you for communication, a fervent plan, we implore you to open our campus.&nbsp;\nSincerely,&nbsp;\nStudents of Loyola Marymount University", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/hd/ck/dyHDckzoMreUOkU-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610568150"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/joe-mazzello-borhap-deleted-scenes-d8a2cdb3-97b6-421e-a21f-c2beadd602af?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Borhap Deleted Scenes", "description": "Bohemian Rhapsody brought many fans together who love the cast &amp; the band.

I would also like to add that Rocket, our pet fox is part of our family. We have established a trust with her, created a bond that will last forever. Disturbing that bond could be devastating to her. We would like to live with our pet without the fear of animal control or anyone else removing her from us, her family. Surrendering her is not an option since that would possibly mean that officials would put her down.\nWe have taken measures to ensure that she has her shots, she sees a vet when needed and she is also in the process of getting spayed next week on Jan 14th. She has NEVER attacked anyone nor bitten anyone. Actually, it's quite the contrary. She brought joy and happiness to those who had the pleasure of meeting the playful, mischievous little fox down the street. Currently, local officials are stating that we cannot have her in the city of Denton because Rocket is considered a wild animal. However, the definition of a wild animal is not clear with respect to the local definition (there is no clear definition) and differs from the state definition.\nAccording to an email from the supervisor of animal control in Denton, it states that the findings are based on the following \u201cThe Canidae are known as canines, and include &nbsp;wolves, foxes, and other extant and extinct species\u201d.\nThe first instinct is to take it to believe that those words came from a website that is managed by the state or city. However, that is not where this comes from. The above statement upon an internet search lists the source as Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a legal source and should not be considered one since even most colleges ban the use of Wikipedia as a credible source. The page speaking of the Canidae family has had over 30 different edits since 2019.\nAlthough the laws leave Rocket in the gray area, we are asking state and local governments to change this to state the true definition of a wild animal, which is an animal not born in captivity. This would exclude Rocket from becoming classified as a wild animal. There should also be a clear law on the rules of a domesticated fox as a pet, allowing others to maintain a fox as a pet. I would also like to add that while it is true that foxes as a pet, is not for everyone, local and state authorities could require prospective fox owners to complete a course that teaches the pros and cons of having a fox as a pet. I would personally have no issue in helping with these types of courses since I can vouch for first hand what it is like to have a fox as a pet. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rocket was born in captivity, not in the wild. Her parents were also born and raised in captivity. Rocket lives indoors with us and her best friend Bella - a dog. As of right now, if we were to surrender Rocket to animal control, they would put her to sleep.\nUnder current law, the only permit to have a fox is called a TWRC Home Rehabber. Unfortunately, the program is on hold with the state website stating&nbsp;\n\"DUE TO COVID 19, OUR HOME-BASED REHABBER PROGRAM IS ON HOLD. WE WILL UPDATE THIS PAGE ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO RESUME THE PROGRAM.

Casey Goodson Jr, another unarmed black man was killed by the CPD three weeks prior. Tuesday morning, the twenty second of December, Officer Adam Coy wrongfully shot and murdered Andre Maurice Hill seconds after their encounter. He was unarmed, simply approaching the garage and holding his cellphone. Both officers who interacted with Hill failed to activate their body cameras until after the encounter which is a violation of the department's protocol. Additionally, the two officers failed to call for emergency medical assistance after the shots were fired, another violation of the protocol. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther stated, \u201cNone of the officers initially at the scene provided medical assistance, no compression on the wounds to stop the bleeding, no attempts of CPR, not even a hand on the shoulder or an encouraging word that medics were en route,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cIt\u2019s an officer\u2019s duty to render aid.\u201d\n17% of black people that are killed by police officers are unarmed.

I have been speaking out&nbsp;about my experience for the last 5 years because when I was taken abroad to be cut at the age of seven, I was told to never speak of it again. I want to make sure this never happens to anyone else and I want Connecticut, my home state, to become a safe place for all girls by passing a law to ban FGM/C.\nMariya - I was born in the United States and live in Massachusetts, and at the age of seven, I, like Zehra, was subjected to Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting. Due to my experience and because I have friends and relatives who have also undergone FGM/C both here in the United States or elsewhere in the world, for over five years, I\u2019ve worked with the Massachusetts Women\u2019s Bar Association to pass legislation protecting girls in my home state from having to undergo this harm too. The bill finally became law in August 2020. Now, I want to support my friend Zehra, in ensuring that her home state, Massachusett\u2019s neighboring state, also passes a law to protect ALL girls from FGM/C.&nbsp;\nFGM/C is a practice that involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue on girls for non-medical reasons. It is internationally recognized as a human rights violation that can result in physical harm including pain, bleeding, shock, tetanus, genital sores, and cause long-lasting psychological harm including sexual disorders, fear of sexual intimacy, nightmares, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nConnecticut is known for its progressive policies in terms of reproductive rights, anti-discrimination laws, and equality issues, yet 39 states have already passed laws banning FGM/C, in some cases as amendments to child abuse laws.&nbsp;\nAs FGM/C is nearly always carried out on minors, is a violation of the rights of children, and reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes that constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women, we must protect girls from undergoing FGM/C.\nBoth of us believe in the importance of education and community engagement to help create social change within communities and amongst groups where FGM/C might be happening. To that end, we each have organized and participated in community events to educate our friends and family members about the harms of FGM/C and why it should be abandoned. Yet, despite our efforts, FGM/C continues, often being touted as a religious or cultural practice that is needed to control women\u2019s sexuality.&nbsp;\nIn 1996, the United States passed a federal law making FGM/C illegal in this country. For the first time ever in 2017, a doctor in Michigan was charged under this law for performing FGM/C on minor girls, highlighting that FGM/C does affect women and girls living in the United States. Then on Nov 20, 2018, in a US district court decision, a judge struck down the federal law on technical grounds, finding that Congress did not have the authority to pass such a law. Rather, the federal judge opined \"As despicable as this practice may be, it is essentially a criminal assault\" and FGM/C was \u201clocal criminal activity\u201d to be regulated by the States.\nWe need a bill in Connecticut that unequivocally reiterates that female genital mutilation/cutting is a form of violence. There are laws against domestic violence and sexual assault and abuse. We need a law against FGM/C as well.\nConnecticut can do a better job of protecting girls by banning FGM/C.\nSign our petition to support us in demanding that legislators pass a bill to make Connecticut the 40th state to ban FGM/C. Let\u2019s work together to take a stance against Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting!&nbsp;\n&nbsp;~ Zehra Patwa &amp;&nbsp; Mariya Taher", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/lm/tn/MvlMTnQzNVXTjLJ-800x450-noPad.jpg?1602879998"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/pitt-county-district-attorney-faris-dixon-drop-the-charges-stop-the-attack-on-our-community?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Drop The Charges, Stop The Attack On Our Community!", "description": "Dedan Waciuri was raised in the struggle by his mother, Greenville organizer, Willie Carol Roberts.

We demand accountability from Representative Debra \u201cDeb\u201d Haaland of New Mexico\u2019s first Congressional district for her exclusion of legislative protections for Freedmen of the Five Slaveholding Tribes of Oklahoma while serving as New Mexico\u2019s First Congressional District\u2019s Representative.\nAs Freedmen of the Five Southeastern Tribes (Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole Nations) now located in Oklahoma, we have precarious relationships with our tribes of origin. Freedmen descend from those enslaved by tribal members in the 1700 and 1800s, as well as Native people who had been tribal members since before European contact, and free Black people who were tribal citizens and members at the time of Dawes enrollment in the late 1800s. With the Treaties of 1866, all five of the Five Southeastern Tribes abolished slavery and promised their Freedmen citizenship and equal rights. However, in all of these tribes but the Cherokee Nation, Freedmen are either denied tribal citizenship rights or deemed second-class citizens.\nIn the Seminole Nation, Seminole Freedmen are enrolled as partial and unequal tribal members and are counted when the Seminole Nation requests federal funding but are excluded from any tribal housing, healthcare, or educational programs or funding on account of their race--a modern Three-Fifths Compromise. In the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Creek Nations, \u201cFreedmen\u201d are not only denied housing, healthcare, and educational programs, but are also denied basic citizenship and voting rights on account of their race and their ancestors\u2019 statuses as Black and/or enslaved people. Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Creek Freedmen are also excluded from protections afforded Native children in the Indian Child Welfare Act on account of being excluded from tribal citizenship. These modern-day Jim Crow policies can no longer be tolerated. We need a Secretary of the Interior who will enforce the Five Tribes\u2019 treaty obligations to Freedmen and who will investigate and end the discriminatory Jim Crow policies in Indian Territory.\nRepresentative Deb Haaland\u2019s past legislative action indicates that she is not a strong supporter of protections for Black Native \u201cFreedmen\u201d of the Five Tribes in Oklahoma. In December 2019, Representative Haaland co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) through 2024 that removed protections for Freedmen of the Five Tribes that had previously been included in bills reauthorizing the funding. Although constituting only 5 of the 573 federally recognized tribes in the United States, the U.S. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has informed the Five Tribes that they can expect to receive 10% of the program\u2019s funding--over $62 million in funding for the program. However, as it currently stands, four out of the Five Tribes receiving this large amount of funding would exclude Freedmen from it solely on account of their race and/or due to being descendants of Black slaves. As Freedmen, we believe that our tribes must follow their own treaties and basic human rights and civil rights principles in order to receive federal tax payer-funded resources.&nbsp;\nDeb Haaland must speak up now as Biden's nominee for Secretary of the Interior in support of Freedmen of the Five Tribes and--when appointed to the office of Secretary of the Interior--must work diligently to ensure that our rights as Native people are protected. As Secretary of the Interior, she will oversee the Bureau of Indian Affairs and will have the power to investigate the tribes, enforce our treaty rights, and bring an end to the modern-day Jim Crow we are facing. We must have Native leadership that is inclusive of all Native peoples, Black Natives and Freedmen included. Representative Haaland, as Secretary of the Interior, will have the power to uphold the citizenship and civil rights of Freedmen of the Five Tribes. She should understand that this is racism pure and simple, and it\u2019s time to stop Jim Crow like policies in Indian Country.\nFreedmen and our enslaved ancestors have shared culture and community with other tribal members for generations, and it is time that we are given equal access to our nation and community. Freedmen have long oral histories of our ancestors\u2019 time on the Trail of Tears and in Indian Territory, attend and lead tribal events, speak tribal languages, and identify strongly with our tribes of origin. For us, citizenship is not just a piece of paper or a CBID card, but is the confirmation of our history and our culture.&nbsp;\nAs a Native American woman, Deb Haaland has a moral responsibility to end this racism.

Like our other Brevard County public schools, they receive government funds, including recent grants from the CARES act. On December 7th, 2020, PCCA administration announced they were discontinuing virtual instruction and gave 300+ students and families only 4 days to decide if they'd return to a PCCA campus or forfeit their spot and unenroll. To our knowledge, this is the only school in Brevard County that will no longer offer a virtual option.\nParents of PCCA students and members of our community ask that the PCCA administration and school board fulfill their roles as educators and community leaders during this time of crisis. We ask that PCCA not discriminate against medically vulnerable families who simply want their child to continue receiving the same prestigious and classical curriculum that they began the year with. We understand the burden to the PCCA establishment and its teachers but implore them to stand strong during these tough times, put the children of our community first, and make it a priority to continue educating ALL of the students who earned a place at PCCA for the 2020-2021 school year.\n&nbsp;\nWhy can't these children just resume in-person classes at PCCA?\nWe, like most parents, understand and value the benefit of in-person classes and can't wait for our children to return to their teachers and friends. However, many parents also have immunocompromised and elderly family members they are desperate to protect from Covid-19. Florida is reporting record case numbers and positivity rates. Our Nation, Florida and Brevard County are in the midst of the worst outbreak we've seen since the pandemic began. While we know PCCA has taken measures to keep our children safe, they do not have a mask mandate for their students and have one of the highest Covid case counts in all of Brevard County. Parents are effectively being asked to choose between their child's education or their community and family's safety.\n&nbsp;\nWhy should PCCA have to offer a virtual option for a limited group of students?\nAdmission to PCCA is through an extremely competitive lottery. Parents try for years to get their child enrolled at PCCA. If they are lucky enough to get a spot, students are often leaving the school and friends they've been with for years to take advantage of the high-quality and prestigious education that PCCA offers. PCCA's curriculum and scheduling is vastly different than other schools, making a transition to another public-school option extremely difficult. And, Parents who opted for the virtual option at the beginning of the school year couldn't have possibly expected or foreseen that PCCA would terminate virtual education in the middle of the school year and during our state's worst virus peak yet. For those families who simply can't risk in-person classes, it should be PCCA's obligation to ensure these students have an option to continue with their current curriculum and teachers.\n&nbsp;\nCan't children continue virtual instruction at Brevard Virtual School or home school?\nThe virtual instruction and e-learning options currently offered across Brevard County Schools are interactive, face-to-face (via Zoom/Google) classes in which a teacher is still guiding each aspect of the student's lessons throughout the day. Virtual e-learning students also have plenty of opportunity to interact and socialize with their classmates. Brevard Virtual School and home school options are much different. They offer little, if any social interaction with peers, and require a great deal of independence from the student and involvement from the parent. While parents may have been able to arrange for their child to attend school from home, many still work full-time jobs and depend on the virtual teachers to educate their children as they simply don't have the means to guide their education themselves.\n&nbsp;\nBrevard Public Schools still offer e-learning, go there.\nPCCA offers Latin, orthography, Riggs Reading, and Singapore Math\u2014evidence-based practices in pedagogy. The public education system is sadly very, very slow to adopt to these newer but effective and proven teaching technologies. Their curriculum is entirely different that what is currently offered at BCPS. Switching schools mid-year is already incredibly tough on children but necessary sometimes due to a move or other family circumstance.

Equivalent reductions in the budget have ALREADY been identified by the Timberlane Regional School District Budget Committee WITHOUT cutting this program.\nThe FLES program extends from kindergarten to 5th grade with a focus on speaking and listening skills. Learning Spanish in elementary schools builds students skills that transfer into other disciplines such as problem solving, critical thinking, memory, concentration, ability to multitask and listening skills. In addition, elementary students are uniquely set up to acquire languages as human brains are designed to learn languages before the age of puberty, as such the earlier a student learns a second language the greater the capacity they will have to continue to learn language to degrees akin to native speakers. Spanish is the second most widely spoken language in the world and the US is the second largest Spanish speaking country after Mexico.

Eventually, Naya's friends and family were the ones looking for her, before police decided to resume their efforts after public outcry. Despite all of this, Naya was unfortunately found dead. What really irksome about this entire situation is the very clear double standard being shown here. If Naya was white, we all know that the search, coverage, and treatment of her case would have been much greater, and quicker. But since she was a woman of color, it was supremely downplayed by the media and police alike.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nNow, her ex-husband Ryan Dorsey is suing, alleging that her death was preventable, which is absolutely true. United Water Conservation District and Parks Management Company should be held responsible for the neglect when it came to the safety warnings of the lake, safety of the boat she rented, and other things. In fact, Naya Rivera is also not only person to have died in Lake Piru. Six people drowned from 1994-2000, and the former parks and recreation services manager claims that there were 23 cases of people drowning. Clearly, this lake is not suitable for public recreation. Among the list of damages Dorsey is suing for, child endangerment is not one of them. Naya's son Josey, was left alone for a long period of time ON A LAKE, on a boat by himself.

The system began to incorrectly reject numerous mental health claims. Since that time, payments have either not been made or have been incorrectly or underpaid to mental health facilities for services already rendered.&nbsp; Mental health clinics, mental health professionals, and hospitals which treat patients with Medicaid insurance in Maryland have been without sufficient income to function for the past year. This has created a domino effect of inability of clinics to take on new patients, clinic closures, mass lay offs of mental health professionals, and understaffing of mental health and substance use disorder clinics and other treatment facilities.&nbsp; This is causing lack of access to mental health care and poor mental health outcomes such as a rise in suicides and opioid overdoses in the state.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Patients have been either unable to get mental health care at all, or face dangerously long waiting times for mental health treatment.&nbsp; This is at a time when the stress of the pandemic and the economic fallout have caused a higher than normal amount of mental health concerns among people in Maryland.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, to mass lay offs of mental health care workers, other administrative hurdles will prevent rebuilding of the mental health system even after economic fixes are put in place.&nbsp;For example, mental health and medical professionals must undergo credentialing when being hired or opening up clinics, offices, facilities or hospitals.&nbsp; &nbsp;After hiring, the credentialing of mental health professionals can take 3-6 months. Therefore, the staff shortages in facilities are likely to continue throughout the next year.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I respectfully ask that legislation and other actions be taken urgently as follows:\n1. Open all outpatient mental health services to Maryland residents regardless of the ability to meet health insurance criteria. Consider a program such as the program in San Francisco that allows any resident to go to any clinic or practice and receive timely mental health treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n2. &nbsp;Help fund larger outpatient clinics to have social supports such as food pantries , eviction prevention Sevices ,Hire employment professionals (job coaches, employment insurance associates and trained volunteers) and embed them in clinics to help patients receiving mental health treatment to keep their jobs, transition to new jobs, and bridge unemployment gaps by registering them as volunteers with various agencies.\n3.&nbsp; Begin Emergency credentialing of mental health professionals on par with other medical professionals throughout the pandemic as long as needed to reduce patient suffering and improve access to care and lessen wait times.\n4.&nbsp; Enforce federal and state mental health parity.&nbsp; Enact the IMD waiver. Remove prior authorization for medications and denial of meds at the point of pharmacies for patients who's providers are not on the medicaid panel.\n5. &nbsp; Finally, It is my hope that all leaders involved can publicly acknowledge the scope of the problem and commit to taking appropriate action.&nbsp; This problem will not get better simply by reimbursing a few clinics.\n&nbsp; I would appreciate if you would let me know your action on this matter.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;", "image_url": "https://static.change.org/profile-img/default-user-profile.svg"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/amy-klobuchar-remove-governor-walz-emergency-powers?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Remove governor Walz emergency powers", "description": "We need to remove Governor Walz emergency powers.

Fulton County Schools (FCS) did the second community informational meeting on the K8 schools on Monday 1/11/2021, and the presentation main topic was the attendance districts, and changes to be made due to K8. They presented Alternative Plan A and Alternative Plan B, and tables of associated capacities. Both of these plans split the city of Hapeville into 2 different elementary/middle school patterns.\nIn these plans, parts of Hapeville residents will attend the Hapeville K8 and part of the residents will attend Parklane Elementary and then Woodland Middle.\nNO change that splits Hapeville is acceptable, and we need to speak up now if we want to be heard on this.\nFor our comments to be considered for this information session, we have to email by Wednesday, 1/13.\nTalking points (if you would like them - please feel free to use your own or add to...):\n1) The strengths of K8 is the academic success which is only fostered through the continued access to community support, and the continuity of the relationships between the parents, teachers and students providing for the emotional well being, stability of environment and school culture. These feed the success of kids in our small community. Hapeville is approximately 2.25 square miles, with only about 1.25 of that residential - there should not be so many kids to need to split the attendance district.\n2) Hapeville has spent money on infrastructure creating a safe, walkable community - including school access. If Hapeville is split, property taxes paid by residents could impact the support for a school where their kids DON'T attend.\n3) With Hapeville being geographically close to many other school districts (APS, DeKalb, Clayton), student attendance numbers may not actually be reflective of students correctly attending HES.\n4) Why can HES not be renovated or altered in a way to accommodate all the students in our city for a K-8? Why are we forced to only consider changing attendance districts?\nNext Steps after you email:Attend the Teams meeting on Jan. 25th This is the final community meeting on K8. They will be presenting the findings from the comments and what they will then present to the Board. You can access the meeting from the Fulton County Schools website - https://www.fultonschools.org/Page/22335 - it's near the bottom, where they will link to the meeting. (There is also a lot of K8 info there.)Attend the Fulton County School Board meetings in March for the final votes.\nThere are 2 meetings in a month; one at the North Learning Center and one at the South Learning Center. I will be at both, if any one else wants to attend. They are also broadcast.

To this day, Officer Douglas Downing who unlawfully fired his weapon multiple times and killed Darius is still employed by Denton PD. He was never placed on leave pending an investigation. As a non-Denton resident who inflicted serious harm on our community, Officer Downing has faced zero repercussions for his actions which led to an egregious and unnecessary loss of life in our community.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even worse, all this time, he has been protected, afforded more protection for a year than he could afford Darius in 15 minutes. While the Denton community was provided the names of four officers involved after the shooting, along with a combined portion of body cam footage, to this day, there has been no formal investigation conducted by the Denton County District Attorney\u2019s Office, and there has yet to be a Grand Jury summoned to review the evidence. All the while, Officer Downing, the killer cop from Little Elm continues to travel to Denton daily to \u201cprotect and serve\u201d our community.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we approach the one-year anniversary of Darius Tarver\u2019s execution, we owe it to Darius' memory and his family to at least ensure a renewed conversation centered on the facts so as to put a spotlight on the threat these officers pose to our community. So let's review the facts as they were presented by the Denton Police Department one year ago via the body cam footage and see if the actions of this DPD Officer can still be defended as heroic.

The asked for amendment regarding the signage would be inline with what our own Planning and Zoning Committee approved on January 11, 2021 after hearing from citizens present at their meeting. Unfortunately at the initial CUP approval by city council the recommendation from P&amp;Z was not upheld.\nPlease join me in asking our mayor and city council to make the needed amendment as well as asking Spec's to do the right thing for our children - keep the cute bunny off of our local store sign!", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/av/iz/qvavIZhvMlebIwg-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610648924"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/tim-walz-to-stop-discrimation-of-race-in-kinship-relative-fostering-adoption?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "To stop discrimation of race in kinship relative fostering/adoption In Mn", "description": "We need more power, justice, respect, change, and diversity in our social services agencies. The system is corrupt. According to DHS laws a social services agency is supposed to do their due diligence to see if a family is fit to get a family member out of the foster care system. If a relative steps up, they are suposed to do a background check on them, and consider them as an option. If they say that family member is considered then they must follow through. Olmsted lied to us and told us we were being considered then when family right were terminated they acted like I did not exist. My family has been lied to and misled by Olmsted County.&nbsp;\nMy husband and I, have been trying to get my niece out of foster care since Oct 1 2019, we responded a month after receiving the letter in the mail about my niece being in foster care. My mother was working on getting her grand child and has been in communcation with the county about getting my niece.&nbsp; I waited until it didn't work. The county did say why my mother wasn't considered.&nbsp; My husband and I came forward after hearing this did not work out.&nbsp;\nWhen we came foward, I had to wait until the family conference to discuss placement with my niece due to unknown reasons. It taken 2 months for the family conference to take place. The family conference was schedule for Dec 6th, 2019. At that family conference, I told my niece foster parents, guardian at lietm, my niece social worker, adoption worker, my niece other family, and other olmsted workers that I wanted to foster my niece. My niece social worker said, they are not interested in moving her anymore since she has already been in 5 different homes within two months. We then said we want to adopt her on Dec 6, 2019 at the family conference, and they said you guys will be considered if the parents rights are terminated and to be patience. I said okay, well can we see her? We were told from the social worker that she will speak to my niece therapist to see if its a good idea. She didnt get back to us. We ask again.. no response. . didn't get a call from my niece social worker until a month after and they asked if we were still interested to adopt my niece and if they all can meet with us in person to discuss details. Of course, we said yes, where and when??...&nbsp;\nThe meeting was schedule March 13th, 2020. The county met with us at my home 3/13/20 and discussed details and later said, let's wait this all out.. but you guys are considered as a placement option. I have text messages to prove this. On 4/13/20 got a call that the courts were shut down due to Covid-19 and that they will give us more details when they get closer to rights being terminated. So in that time we decided to move into a bigger home to make more room for my niece if rights were terminated we wanted to be prepared to take my niece and have a room for her. We moved in two months. During this time we did not hear back from my niece social worker or from family on the status of the case. We thought the courts were still on hold. We were also supposed to see my niece and the social worker never got back to us on that as well.\nWhat happened and what went wrong? We thought we did everything right and was doing our due diligence to get things done what they asked us to do before adoption. They told us they will help us before rights were terminated, but everything was on hold.&nbsp;\nOn 6/26/20 rights were terminated?? Huh husband and I felted ghosted. Huh when did the courts open back up? We made numerous of calls to the Olmsted after hearing rights were terminated. We did not find out the parents rights were terminated until July 16th. The social worker has my number and she could have updated me. She did not and now acting like I do not exist.\nWe were frustrated because Olmsted County told us that they will get us ready before the parents rights were terminated and they wanted to make us look good in front of the judge by preparing us with a home study. They also told us that they will help us see my niece and felt really optimistic about that back in March 20/20..I told them its important to see my niece because I did not want her to go to long without seeing us, but if they told us this why did they ghosted us?\nOn 10/6/20, we finally started the home study process because Olmsted County finally sent a referral over to LSS. Finally assigned a worker to us and she tells us we need a lawyer because my niece could be adopted any day now?? Huh?? How could this happen??? We are so lost and confused.. The told us once the referral was sent over we would get a chance to step in front of the judge, but they lied again.. they moved on without us. No call back or anything. No updates??\nI called a Lawyer Mark Fiddler on Oct 6, 2020 and they told me according to Mn status 260c.260 I am supposed to be sent a placement letter regarding to my niece and to study this status. He told me to call Olmsted County and to demand a placement letter and that they have 30 days to send that letter. The county was tired of my calls and set a meeting with us on Oct 15th, 2020 to discussed details regarding my niece and that they will send me a placement letter as soon as it gets closed to my niece placement hearing. They said my niece could get adopted in months and that I should send the county a letter and they will file a motion on my behalf. They also said I should file&nbsp; motion to intervene the adoption once the placement letter is sent out for me to intervene the adoption. I said okay, will do! Never recieved a placement letter.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nMy husband and I, have stable income, have a home, flexible job, married, and eager/desire to be there to support my niece. I have been trying to adopt her since she was two years old, but her mother changed her mind and so now 3 years later she ended up in the foster care system. My niece has needs and I have my Masters in Mental health psychology with 12 years of experiece dealing with challenging behaviors. I feel like my experience has allowed me the experiece to handle anything that comes my way. I love kids. I have a 5 year old daughter who I love to pieces and will do anything for.&nbsp;\nMy family and I trusted in the system that they would do whats right for my niece and her family. Olmsted County has never made any follow-up or follow through with what they said and they have always been in favor of the foster family. Everyone I saw at Olmsted County is white and it seems like they can care less about my niece family. They never advocated for my niece. They just did what was easy for them. I even asked if I can get my niece on weekends and they told me that is a dream and that may never happen.This is injustice and I feel like if I was white, my family would have been treated differently by Olmsted County. There is no reason why my family should have been over looked. Olmsted County never exercised their due diligence to see if my husband and I was a good fit or not. They never did a background check on us. I trusted in the system and waited for them and now time and time has past and now I am getting blamed by others that I waited to long to say something?? What?? Ridiculous.. my niece was separated from her siblings, lost her parents, and now she is losing her family due to the negligence of the system. Since Aug 2019 she has been in foster care. I have been doing everything trying to get my niece and I will not give up.\nOut of 11 states, MN is one of them... is a family first state. The agency is supposed to keep kids with their families first and when the rights are terminated they are supposed to see if a family member wants to adopt their family member first and Olmsted County did not do that... they are acting like I do not exist and that they never considered me as an option. I called supervisors and left voice-mails, child protection workers, ect.. in Olmsted County. They told me to write a letter to the county.. they responded to my letter by saying we want to rule out Brianna to the judge.They disregarded my letter. My lawyer even said, Olmsted County is up to something...Now I am told I have to intervene in order to stop the adoption.\nMy husband and I, needs you guys help.. we need the state to know the truth. Family did step foward and continuing to step foward, but misled by Olmsted County and felt like they judged us due to color of our skin.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/dj/zr/prdJzrXsEpdkBdj-800x450-noPad.jpg?1604979708"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/the-attorney-general-the-attorney-general-should-indict-those-committed-felonies-riot-a-felony-murder?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "The attorney general should indict those who committed felony riot of felony murder", "description": "Those who incited riot and rioted at our nations capital yesterday violating 18 U.S. Code Sec. 2101 should be charged with felony murder for the deaths of four people who died as a result of the rioting.

Board eligibility and board certification is essentially a requisite in working in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation;\n2. Board eligibility expires within a fixed amount of time after completion of a physical medicine and rehabilitation residency;\n3. Board certification examinations should provide a minimum threshold to protect the public and ensure minimum standards for working in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation;\n4. Oral examinations have problematic issues of validity and reliability;\n5. Other physiatry board counterparts have either waived or are reanalyzing the necessity of the oral boards including the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the American Osteopathic Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation;\n6. Any published study written by ABPMR are inherently biased and furthermore such studies suggest a positive correlation between milestone competencies (reflecting expectations in residency) to Part I scaled scores but no predictive correlation between milestone competencies and Part II.&nbsp; (Francisco, Gerard, Yamazaki, Kenji, Raddatz, Mikaela, et al.

This suggests that Part II and residency programs are not aligned in the expectation of competencies of physiatrists;\n7. Keeping an exam purely as a rite of passage does not protect our patients or the physiatrists who dedicated their passion and livelihood for their patients;\n8. Other specialties that regularly care for a significantly more acutely sicker population and often require quick decision making have eliminated oral examinations such as: family practice, internal medicine, pathology, diagnostic radiology, neurology, pediatrics, and psychiatry;\n9. Neurology is the closest counterpart to physical medicine and rehabilitation and does not require an oral examination even though they run high intensity emergent stroke codes as well as rapid responses and code BLUE and thus require fast and deliberate thinking and yet board certified neurologists are competent and privileged to work at their highest level; and\n10. Psychiatry does not require an oral examination even though they deal with patients with equally complex psychosocial issues as physical medicine and rehabilitation and yet board certified psychiatrists are competent and privileged to work at their highest level.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/ru/ip/JDruiPepZoKwqWc-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606186071"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/chacellor-richard-carranza-give-nyc-students-a-break-for-regents-week?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Give NYC students a break for regents week", "description": "Recently the Board of Regents and New York State Education Department (NYSED) canceled all January Regents.

We have been completely compliant and supportive of these decisions, but we are starting to notice harmful effects on our schools. Students do not feel involved or included in their own schools, and if you were to walk through the hallways there is a noticeable gloom. The decisions that have been made are supposed to be best for the students, but how do district officials know what is best for us when they are not in our classrooms, not walking in our hallways, and hardly asking for our input or feelings. The disconnect we are experiencing between students and the district school board is causing tensions between students and faculty at our high schools. Students are unsatisfied and teachers and admin cannot help, because these decisions are out of their hands. Students crave so deeply to have the experiences that we have been excited for.&nbsp;\nDances and Assemblies are a crucial part of our cultures at school. Things like Prom and Homecoming, Student Sections, and Spirit Assemblies are rites of passage for every high schooler. For most adults, these are the memories they look back on with fondness. Students this year are being robbed of those experiences that most of our parents got to have. There is nothing that unites our schools more than gathering together for these activities.

However, colorectal cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths. Moreover, there has been a 51% increase in colorectal cancer diagnoses among people younger than 50. 60% of colorectal cancer deaths could be prevented through screening. When colorectal cancer is detected early, costs are reduced and survival rates greatly increase. Relying on comprehensive studies, in May of 2018, the American Cancer Society updated their recommendation that all US adults at average risk undergo regular screening beginning at age 45 years.\nWhat is the solution?\nThe New Jersey State Legislature has introduced two bills that can save so many lives and we need your help to pass.\n1) A5034/S3282 - This will require health benefit plans to cover colorectal cancer screenings for people of average risk starting at age 45 instead of 50. People who are of high risk will still be able to get screened earlier.\n2) ACR196/SCR139 - This will urge the United States Preventative Services Task Force to lower its recommended colorectal cancer screening age from 50 to 45. This will help reduce the recommended screening age across the country instead of just New Jersey.\nWhat can I do to help?\n1) Sign this petition to demonstrate your support of the change.\n2) Contact your State Legislator and let them know that you want them to vote to reduce the age of colorectal cancer screenings.

This proposed ruling is extreme, opposed by many hunters, would have a severe economic impact and was hastily rushed through the process which raises concerns of bias.\n1.) Trail cameras are the marketing department of hunting, the outdoors and conservation. Many new hunters are born off of the ability to see animals they may not have the time, knowledge of location(where to start) or ability to see. We get to experience and enjoy natural animal behavior in their home environment, driving our passion for the land.\n2.) Men, women &amp; children enjoy physical activity in the outdoors by placing trail cameras in strategic locations to capture these amazing events. This drives physical well being and health for all involved.\n3.) Gas, Food, Lodging (out of state hunters), vehicle maintenance, etc is garnered by local businesses due to in-state and out of state hunters spending their time and money to put boots on the ground and understand their pursuit.\n4.) The use of a trail camera's IN NO WAY guarantee success during a hunt and does not have any direct correlation to \"quality or trophy\" related success. If anything, we often hold out for something we will most likely never see again. Trail cameras do not change the fair chase ethos that we as sportsman support. This statement is supported by organizations like The Pope and Young Club. \"The Pope and Young Club, historically, has not viewed the use of trail cameras as a violation of the Rules of Fair Chase.\"\n5.) Trail Cameras IN NO WAY change the habits or patterns of animals. The hunting community has years of photos to prove this. These cameras are non intrusive, passive devices that take nothing more than a picture or short video clip. These cameras do not affect the hunting experience of others or their success. Trail cameras are not just being used by hunters. There are no restrictions on camping, target shooting or other public land activities during hunting seasons. Trail cameras should not be any different.\n6.) Arizona Game and Fish Department solely owes the gratitude for the discovery of jaguars in Arizona to Trail Cameras. If it were not for these unobtrusive cameras placed in the southern mountains of Arizona, the discovery and information on these elusive beautiful creatures would not have been captured and turned in for research purposes to the Game &amp; Fish Department. On this specific event alone, the current commission sends a message of ignorance and ungratefulness to the utilization of these amazing tools, with no regard for our help and commitment to them in the past on information collection and provision us hunters have provided to biologists within the department.\n7.) If our game and fish department wanted to be proactive and operate on a positive note, I propose they research and explore the actions needed to add trail cameras to the Pittman Robertson Act of 1937. This would vastly generate funds for all wildlife departments across the states, wherever trail cameras are sold locally.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/aq/rf/zSaqRfPcLixTxVh-800x450-noPad.jpg?1607270712"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/city-of-little-rock-board-of-directors-fight-to-oppose-giant-apartment-complexes-in-little-rock-neighborhoods?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Fight to Oppose Giant Apartment Complex in Little Rock Neighborhood", "description": "Please help us as we fight the encroaching development in our older, established Little Rock neighborhoods.&nbsp; We are fighting a rezoning action in the heart of Little Rock which will allow a multi-story high density apartment complex in the very heart of the city we love.&nbsp;\nFor detailed information on this rezoning effort please go to www.stopbrookside.com\nThe neighborhoods of Little Rock MUST act together to stop these encroaching developments.&nbsp; Help us to help you!&nbsp; Sign our petition, it will be forwarded to the Little Rock Board of Directors, and your voice will be heard.&nbsp; Go to www.stopbrookside.com for even more actions that you can take to oppose this rezoning.

Both teenagers are prior victims of sex trafficking. While they sit in prison on murder charges along with their sex trafficker, they are in dire conditions. They need access to comprehensive mental health care and should be recovery programs, not jail.&nbsp;\nAbout Jessica and Jordan:\nJessica\u2019s abuse and exploitation began when she was sexually abused beginning at age 5 by her uncle who forced her to use drugs as he assaulted her. Typical of most trafficked girls in America, Jessica\u2019s father was never in her life.&nbsp; At 14, Jessica met a guy online and soon ran away to be with him. Her dreams of love were soon shattered when he trafficked her to Colorado where where she was eventually found in an FBI sting operation to rescue child victims of sex trafficking. Those traffickers were convicted but the trauma they inflicted remained.\nJessica was sent to Los Angeles to a shelter where she was soon lured into running away by another girl whose pimp attempted to rape and sell her. Alone on the streets of LA, Jessica was quickly trafficked by a member of a local gang who passed her around to gang members across LA. Finally, Jessica was found 10 months later and sent back home to her mother to recover. Jessica eventually found a job at a thrift store where she made friends with another older employee, Breez Collier. She confided her past in Breez who quickly began to pressure her into drugs. By June, Breez had Jessica in a hotel with grown men where she was selling her.\nJessica\u2019s attempt at running away soon led her into the hands of yet another gang-involved pimp whose violence led her to running again. Soon, another trafficker found and exploited her.&nbsp; Finally, Jessica was found and sent back to her mother where she began to recover.&nbsp; She found a job at a local thrift store where she met another employer, 24 year old Breez Collier.&nbsp; As they bonded, Jessica confided her past in Breez who soon began to pressure her to use drugs. By June, Jessica was being sold by Breez while living with grown men inside a hotel room.&nbsp;\nBreez soon began to sexually abuse Jessica\u2019s little brother, Jordan. Text messages between Breez and Jordan reveal messages of love and sex, an intoxicating blend for a 14 year old boy. What he thought was a romantic relationship was really what is known in the field of anti-trafficking as \u201cgrooming.\u201d Children with prior histories of abuse are prime targets for the \u201clove tactic\u201d Breez used. His loyalty to Breez soon led him into being a victim of child sex trafficking, too. Studies indicate that upwards of 45% of trafficked children are boys. Jordan loved cooking, basketball and being a prankster.&nbsp; He also loved his older sister and often would defend her from men who were sexually harassing her. With no man in the house, Jordan assumed the role of father and husband as many young boys without father\u2019s around do.&nbsp;\nOn March 26, 2018, gang-affiliated men came to the home of Amy Cage, Jessica and Jordan\u2019s mother. They fought with Amy with the intent on forcing Jessica back on the streets. According to police reports, Amy called the police 15 times to report the threat of these men and fear they would take her daughter.&nbsp; That night, as these three men beat Amy, Jordan came out to fight for his mother and sister. Amy managed to get him inside and grab a gun to shot one of the men in the leg. Amy was arrested and soon released. She sustained bruising on the brain and many more injuries. She staved the men off but Jessica remained at risk.\nAmy didn\u2019t see Breez, a 24-year-old young woman, as a threat at first. By the time she did, both of her children were already ensnared into Breez\u2019s trap. It\u2019s not uncommon for traffickers to be women. The shock that Ghislaine Maxwell would recruit and groom young girls for the wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein stunned many around the world. However, having worked directly with over 2000 survivors of human trafficking, I know that many traffickers are women. Many male traffickers also use female victims to recruit other girls.\nTraffickers often use their victims to commit other crimes, such as robbery. On June 14th, 2020, Breez took her two teen victims, Jessica and Jordan, to a parking lot where they were to work with her to rob 24-year-old former enlisted Army surgical technician Shareef Raekwon Ali-Barnett.&nbsp;Shareef was not new to purchasing sex. In April 2018, he was arrested for solicitation in conjunction with an illicit massage business, the second top location where sex trafficking occurs according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. The deal was to purchase Jessica and Jordan in exchange for money and drugs.&nbsp; Shareef is now dead and now the two teen victims of sex trafficking sit in Texas jails, along with their trafficker.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/yf/ih/ZAyfIhNdcTvsKwW-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610405894"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/cci-alumni-to-make-clear-creek-a-better-school-for-future-students?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "To make Clear Creek a better school for future students", "description": "The problem we have is our school is very unsanitary, dirty, and it\u2019s not the best facility to be learning in due to everything going on.

One way to do that would be through clothes and having your own style. Us having to wear uniforms takes away from our freedom. Another reason would be because how uncomfortable uniforms are and how much they distract students. Us wearing what's comfortable would create a better learning place. It can further help academic performances by wearing clothes that are actually comfortable to us, and we actually like them. Uniforms add expenses that some families simply can't afford. Many parents and students agree that they should be able to go in clothes that they already own. The argument that kids should wear school uniforms to help the gap between the rich and the poor if we all wear the same thing nobody would bully people for not being able to wear name brand clothing or those who \"don't have fashion sense,\" but uniforms could really be the key to solve that problem. The people who can't afford to buy new uniforms would buy second hand. If they had siblings who've graduated from the school, the uniforms would be passed down. There are people who have school uniforms made cheaper so it wouldn't be as expensive, and people who can't afford expensive shoes. In saying all of this school uniforms wouldn't be the key to fix students bullying other students, there would still be a gap between the rich and the poor because students would be able to scope out if somebody's uniform is old or new by how faded it would look. And also, if somebody didn't have name brand shoes or new shoes... my point/argument is that there are still ways to show the gap between the rich and the poor even if we're all wearing school uniforms. In conclusion, these are reasons why we think people should support our petition and idea of why we should be able to wear casual clothing.

They propose downsizing &nbsp;Asheville Primary to a program and moving it into Hall Fletcher Elementary School. They are proposing to move the Preschool classes to unknown spaces around the district.}\nJoin us to prevent a short-sighted dissolution of two fully-enrolled and successful programs within ACS and the sale of the campus on Haywood Road in West Asheville. The families, staff, and supportive community of Asheville Primary School feel that the decision to sell the building at 441 Haywood Rd. and redistribution of the Asheville City Preschool and public Montessori school currently housed there to other spaces is short-sighted and is being made hastily without a long-term plan for what is best for the community. Stakeholders\u2019 requests for an open dialogue with district leadership and Board of Education Members have been denied. These drastic decisions that impact the entire Asheville community should not be made during a pandemic, under new leadership, and without stakeholder involvement. Transparency is needed on what the actual costs and repairs are and about why this agenda is being rammed through right now.\n\nWe request that all decisions regarding the selling of the building be put off for a minimum of 2 years. The district has already invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into renovations and should continue to renovate the space instead of sacrificing a long-term asset for a short term gain. During that time both programs should be able to keep full occupancy of the building. The community of West Asheville would be greatly altered if the school was sold to a private buyer or developer. The school currently serves the needs of our community by offering free and affordable high quality preschool options to some of our most vulnerable families.\nWe request that the Preschool and Montessori programs remain intact and continue to benefit from shared space and collaboration between the exceptional educators of both programs.\nWe request that we preserve the 7 highly effective, 5-Star preschool classrooms on the Asheville Primary campus while continuing to branch out with additional satellite classrooms at other ACS elementary schools or other community locations that best serve Asheville\u2019s 3 and 4 year olds.\nWe request that the Montessori program be expanded to 4th grade for the 2021-2022 school year and 5th grade for the 2022-2023 school year. Keeping our current 3rd graders in the school through 5th grade will allow the district to collect data on students who have benefited from Montessori learning since Kindergarten. This data will be essential for the district to see the benefits of public Montessori when making decisions regarding the future of the program.\nWe request open enrollment in APS Montessori, not limited to just siblings of current APS students so we can obtain accurate longitudinal data on a fully functioning public Montessori school. Public Montessori schools across the US have shown positive outcomes in closing the opportunity gap, especially increasing positive outcomes for students of low-income backgrounds. We request that the district fully commit to Asheville Primary Montessori as a pre-K to 5th grade school, joining the ranks of the rest of the public elementary schools in the district's magnet program, instead of downgrading it and limiting enrollment and therefore limiting the ability for accurate longitudinal data.\n\nThere has been significant investment in this building over the past 5 years including a new playground, a new parking lot, a new media center, new gym roof, cafeteria updates and mold abatement and office renovations. Yes, the building has issues but the staff of both programs love the space, the natural light, the safe outdoor access, outdoor classroom spaces, and more.\nWhat happens in a few years post-Covid when ACS is again bursting at the seams and this building has been sold? We all know property within Asheville City limits is not inexpensive or easy to come by. Please take a look at this issue, insist on a 5-10 year plan for ACS, and don't let a short-sighted plan to rectify a budget deficit allow this hasty plan to move forward.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/cc/hk/hHCChkRsQaXcMyg-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608142005"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/toyota-motor-company-i-want-animal-abuse-to-stop?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "I want animal Abuse to stop!", "description": "I want animals to stop being abused like dogs and cats and the wild life to im a only a ten year old girl trying to do this so pls help,I cant do all this my self if you love a sourport animals you will help if you think this is the right thing to do you will help for justice for animals.I love animals with all my heart remember earth was there before us were luck there sharing with us because they care so we should care to animals are beautiful lovely creatures zoo keepers pls help out and every body help&nbsp;&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/pn/xn/sUpnxnElarhSAOA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609960979"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/community-of-south-and-north-sullivan-south-middle-school-raiders?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Sullivan South Middle School\u2014 Raiders", "description": "Tonight the school board decided to ignore the request made to add a vote for Sullivan South Middle School with the mascot of Raiders or Blue Raiders.

Challenge the process that can allow agriculture land to be replaced by a solar facility that would be closer described as industrial use. Advocate for Hanover County to develop a strategic plan for solar in the county before approving Rainbow Trout Solar Partners' proposal. On Feb. 18th, the Hanover Planning Commission will be voting on this project. If approved, this project could change Montpelier forever? Your backyard could be next! Protect the future of Hanover County.\nAdditional Information:\nRainbow Trout Solar Partners have submitted a conditional use permit for a 44-acre solar facility for the property bordering Old Mill Road and St Peters Church Road (roughly 1 mile from Mountain Rd intersection). The land\u2019s current use is pure agriculture and is characterized by truly natural beauty of local crops growing on rolling hills. Additionally, this property currently supports the local agriculture economy with soybeans, hay, straw and other crops.\nThe neighboring property owners fell in love with their own property in addition to the surrounding agriculture beauty of the area. They specifically sought after Hanover county for the natural beauty as opposed to industrial or commercial use areas. They are in shock of the potential impacts of the proposed project to their surrounding beauty of the land that borders their properties as well as the potential environmental impacts.&nbsp;\nZoning Concerns\nHanover County\u2019s Section 2 Land Use document describes goals for the county\u2019s rural areas to be recognized for a vibrant rural environment characterized by:\n\nViable agricultural and forestall resources that are important components of the local economy\nCommunities of spacious low-density residential development within the rural planning area that is reflective of a rural character\nPreserved natural, cultural, and historical resources\n\nUnder Section 26-17, Hanover County defines the purpose of A-1 agriculture land as:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this district is to provide for a full range of agricultural activities and to protect agricultural land, as one of the county's most valuable natural resources, from the depreciating effect of objectionable, hazardous, and unsightly uses. The district is also intended for protection of watersheds, water resources, forest areas, and scenic values, and at the same time to provide for spacious residential development for those who choose this environment and to prevent untimely scattering of more dense urban uses which should be confined to areas planned for efficient extension of public service.\u201d\n\nThe proposed solar facility will be surrounded by \u201c7-ft-tall fixed knot perimeter fence\u201d. The proposal document claims that this type of fencing is commonly used for agriculture and farming purposes. However, the neighbors challenge Rainbow Trout Solar Partners to provide examples of where this type of 7 ft. fencing is commonly used for agricultural purposes within Hanover county. The surrounding properties are actually characterized by 3 or 4 board fencing for livestock, or no fencing at all allowing the area\u2019s wildlife to roam freely. In addition to the proposed fencing, we also challenge Hanover county to provide evidence of:\n\nHow solar facilities fit under the documented definitions and goals of A-1 agriculture land?\nHow can solar panels be characterized as preserving the natural, cultural, and historic resources of the county?\nHow does a solar facility support the viable agriculture local economy?\n\nWe understand that solar mandates have been placed on the county. However, we ask that the county take the time to develop a true strategic plan for locations and timing for solar facilities to be added. Our recommendation is that areas zoned for commercial or industrial use be considered first, since these areas have already moved away from the natural beauty that many Hanover citizens chose for their families and land ownership. Please do not let landowners take advantage of what we see as loopholes under Conditional Use Permits. Please look at the substance behind the proposal:\n\nDoes the substance behind the proposal meet the county\u2019s definitions of A-1 agricultural zoning?\nDoes the proposal meet Hanover\u2019s goals to protect \u201cagricultural land, as one of the county's most valuable natural resources, from the depreciating effect of objectionable, hazardous, and unsightly uses\u201d?\nConsider the permanency of this project. Challenge the developers to provide proof that this land will be able to be returned to agriculture use. There is evidence that shows land used by many solar facilities is depleted of natural resources that can not be replaced. If this is not truly a temporary use either as a result of depleting the land\u2019s natural resources or a long-term project, how can this project be approved as a temporary conditional use permit?\n\nEnvironmental Concerns\nIt is expected that this facility will result in increased runoff that will impact the both the surrounding property but also the broader area due to the creek that runs through the middle of the property that eventually flows into the South Anna River. The proposed solar facility will result the loss of vegetation which helps to minimize runoff into the watershed. Additionally, it is likely that there will be increased runoff due to both rainwater and condensation running off the solar panels. It is possible that this water running off the panels will create trenches further increasing the amount of sediment running into the creek and eventually into the South Anna River. This will likely cause negative environment effects that will exceed the benefit of solar energy.\nIn closing, it is shocking for the surrounding property landowners that property currently zoned as A-1 agriculture does not have to go through a full rezoning process and instead can be granted a conditional use permit that counters all of Hanover County\u2019s goals for A-1 land stated above. The proposed solar facility will:\n\nLikely result in long-term effects on the land parcel preventing it from ever being returned to farm use\nRemove farming jobs and acreage from the county\nDestroy the natural beauty that drew the surrounding residents to the area\n\nPlease sign our online petition to fight Rainbow Trout Solar Partners' proposed solar project on the land bordering Old Mill Rd and St Peters Church Road. Challenge the process that can allow agriculture land to be replaced by a solar project that would be closer described as industrial use.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/1/he/gf/DSHEGFrksDvreGY-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606678025"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/jeff-merkley-make-it-illegal-to-breed-dogs-without-a-license?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Make it illegal to breed dogs without a license", "description": "Around 4 million shelter animals are euthanized each year only because the shelters don't have enough space for them.

I called 911, but the operator did not give the two police officers vital information from my call, if they had received this information, they would have been able to confront the two women who were lying to them; they had my address but no information. I waited for an officer to take my statement but no one came as I was later told it is no longer an automatic visit after a 911 call I must request it.\nThis incident happened on July 12, 2018, the first court date was August 20, 2018, the final court appearance was September 24, 2018, the date of the actual arrest was August 10, 2018, according to the Canandaigua Police Department. This case against this innocent man was finally closed on March 29, 2019. This is a long period of time to distress so many people.\nThe plaintiff is harassing a deaf individual at a hall window in our apartment building in&nbsp; Canandaigua, NY. I am witnessing the plaintiff as she is interfering with my neighbor who is opening the window in order to draw a cross breeze into his apartment, however, this is none of the plaintiffs business; the plaintiff lives on the first floor, and the accused lives on the second floor where this incident took place; it is a tenant/ landlord issue. As the plaintiff is approaching the accused, she is speaking loudly to him and tells him to close the window the air conditioning is on, I hear this and stand up so I can look down to see who is at the window, I see it is the plaintiff who lives on another floor. I know there is no air conditioning, I then hear her calmly say \u201ccall the police\u201d she sounds annoyed but not angry. I thought this is not an issue for the police, it is more of a tenant /landlord issue, but a peace officer will come and will probably send her away, as the accused is doing nothing wrong; he is opening the window for the cross-breeze, which brings in cooler air.&nbsp;\nThis woman, the plaintiff, is escalating herself, it seems by his demeanor that he is ignoring her because he is deaf and knows AC does not exist, her friend, the complainant knows this as well as she lives on this floor. The plaintiff continues yelling at this man who seems puzzled by her involvement as he continues trying to keep the window open, he is using sticks; the plaintiff is escalating herself, he is silent and cannot hear her or understand why she is bothering him, AC does not exist. I watch her as she does seem frustrated with him for not obeying her commands, she becomes hostile and aggressive towards him, as she is yelling,\u201d NO NO AIR CONDITIONING AIR CONDITIONING!! \"&nbsp;she grabs the sticks and yanks them out of the window throwing them down on the sill, the window with its heavy metal frame free - falls slamming down onto my neighbor\u2019s finger, she frantically yells out, \u201c CALL THE POLICE!!!!!\"&nbsp;I get my phone and call 911, I am afraid for her, as she sounds scared, but I find out three weeks later why she sounds so frightened, it is because she has caused him injury and is apparently afraid of his reaction as he is now experiencing intense pain; I know this to be true as I met with his interpreter three weeks later after this incident, my neighbor showed me his finger with a very teary face, it looked awful, the interpreter told me his finger was injured when I saw the window fall; when the police arrive they have not been given the information from my 911 call as I said, it was a tenant dispute over a window, one tenant wants it open for the breeze, he is our immigrant and doesn\u2019t speak English, the other tenant wants it closed, she thinks there is air conditioning but there isn\u2019t any;\u201d he said we already have a car on the way \u201c I said good! because it\u2019s getting pretty heated down there and I\u2019m afraid she might get hit as I could hear more commotion from her, I never heard his voice and I know his voice very well. I put the phone down and went back to the window, the commotion had stopped and she was walking away. I was afraid that her bad behavior was going to cause him to strike out at her, as I knew by her provocation this could happen. The police do not have this information; they only have the lies that these two women are \u201coutrageously\u201d&nbsp; telling them, that my neighbor is opening a window causing the AC to escape, this is why the plaintiff is interfering with him,&nbsp; but AC DOES NOT EXIST, PERIOD! The police cannot understand my neighbor\u2019s demonstrations and without my information, or coming to my apartment to get my statement as I was waiting for them to come after I let them into the building, without knowing that AC does not exist the officers cannot confront these two liars. The police now write an inaccurate and incomplete police report which appears to be biased for the plaintiff, you, the D.A., or your office reads it and accepts it as written, allowing the plaintiff to press charges against this deaf man, who was bullied and is the actual victim in this case.\nMr.Ritts, you told me in an email that your recollection of this case was that my neighbor was moving or removing an AC unit or units and was advised not to do that, but AC does not exist. The impression I received from your email is that I am a complaining witness. You yourself, or your office have not followed the protocol for prosecutors which is titled \u201cThe Right Thing\u201d I will refresh you concerning this topic. It says, What does this mean? It means - you - (the prosecutor) have great power to alter the lives of many people: people accused of crimes, people victimized by crimes, their families and friends, and the community at large. A criminal charge may be life-changing to an accused or victim; it must never be taken for granted. Handle it like a loaded gun; never forget its power to protect or harm.\nIt means we (you) keep an open mind. Not every person who is suspected should be arrested, not every suspect who is arrested should be prosecuted, not every case should be tried, and not every trial should be won. We (you) have the freedom and with it the ethical duty, not to bring a case to trial unless we (you) have diligently sought the truth and are convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Even then, none of us - not the police, the witness, the prosecutor, the judge, nor the juror, - is omniscient or infallible. Like all lawyers, we have an ethical duty to zealously advocate for our client. But unlike other lawyers, the clients we represent is the public, whose interests are not necessarily served by winning every case. A guilty verdict serves our client\u2019s interest only if the defendant is in fact guilty and has received due process.&nbsp;\nSo you see Mr. Ritts, this vital information from \u201cThe Ethical Guidelines for Prosecutors\u201d was missing in my neighbor\u2019s case, we were also at the mercy of an ineffectual public defender who did not follow the appropriate protocol for the deaf that do not know ASL. When I told this P.D. what I saw and heard, he told me he was going to try to get the case dismissed, I thought that was good, as the women were liars, no AC, they were harassing him, this case had no merit due to this outrageous lie, these women have no credibility, how could you believe anything else they say or makeup. This P.D. used an inappropriate dismissal for this case which was an ACD, it should have been a reversal of the charges, but this ACD made my neighbor appear guilty and aggressive at the final court appearance, as this P.D. was not present to defend this innocent man before this judge who was given another lie from the plaintiff by the acting prosecutor, he reads \u201cthe plaintiff wants the refugee to know that in this country you cannot put your hands on other people\u201d emphasis on country and sounds like a reprimand, he then extends an order against him for 6 more months telling him if he doesn\u2019t get into any more trouble his arrest record will be gone. This judge has humiliated him in front of all present, this innocent man that no one has understood tries to rebuttal this lie, as they now are using the appropriate interpreter for the deaf that do not know ASL, but this interpreter stops him, the court is only using this interpreter to speak to this man, he is not allowed to be heard, and the stand-in P.D. says nothing on my neighbor\u2019s behalf, even though my neighbor was innocent and was the true victim, he was falsely accused of letting out AC which was fabricated to the police, a victim of bullying all the way into the court system; but not only did these bullies win in court and waste taxpayer money for 4 court appearances and 5 different interpreters who had to be paid extra for their services. This case would have never gotten past the two police officers if only the Sheriff's department who handles 911 calls had given these officers my information, and had gotten my statement, then a more accurate police report would have been written, and you, the D.A. would see how these women were just out to get him, causing fear, worry, and emotional distress against this deaf individual, where no one was on his side as no one understood him or even cared to, this was proven by not using the appropriate interpreter for the deaf that do not know ASL by his P.D.&nbsp;\nI am asking you, Mr. Ritts to step up, and do the right thing now, as it was missed in the beginning, and charge these two malicious liars for this horrible injustice that they have caused against this innocent man, his families, and friends, as well as wasted taxpayer dollars to this county; these women need to be held accountable for what they have done and have gotten away with, only because the professionals whom I did contact, did little to nothing to stop these women in their pursuit of obtaining the satisfaction of getting him, all the way into the courtroom with no regard for his deafness and inability to hear them, and a blatant disregard for wasting taxpayer money in using the judicial system for their self-enjoyment. You have two solid witnesses myself, and a standing building. The priority of our justice system should be justice, not using it as a platform of hate and prejudice. Please, do The Right Thing, as it is within your power to fix this injustice and hold the actual assailants accountable.\nMost Sincerely,\nVickie Ellers\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/uq/ju/hDuqJUFRXXFQYhm-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610386789"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/level-the-playing-field-allow-libertarian-green-candidates-to-participate-in-debates?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Allow Libertarian, Green candidates to participate in debates", "description": "Americans deserve more open debates.

The Taliban, who harbor extremist Islamist ideology and have systematically undermined women\u2019s human rights over the past 25 years, have refused to accept a ceasefire. Indeed, since the beginning of negotiations, they have increased their violence against both the military and civilians, including targeting educational institutions, killing scores of students.&nbsp;\nWomen of Afghanistan have the most to lose. As there is no evidence that the Taliban have reassessed their extreme approach to the rights of women, girls and minorities, the Taliban\u2019s return to power endangers them. The token presence of women and the exclusion of the UN from peace talks with the Taliban is part of a disturbing trend that puts their rights at risk without a seat at the table.

And we are furious that the police -- who are supposedly responsible for our safety -- are culpable. When shooting beanbag rounds from shotguns and using taser guns are considered \u201cde-escalation,\u201d when someone who has retreated to their home is considered an imminent threat, and when the death of our neighbor is overshadowed by concern for the emotional damage to the officers who killed him, we know that Newton--like the rest of the country--needs radical change.&nbsp;\nWe believe it is important to emphasize that many Newtonians are likely to feel less safe because of the actions of the Newton police -- not more safe. We are less likely to call 911 for help should we or our loved ones experience a mental health emergency since they may be killed by police.\nOur neighbor\u2019s death is an example of how an over-reliance on policing exacerbates harm. With full funding for mental health care, we could have lessened the likelihood of this mental health crisis happening in the first place. With greater access to trained professionals (as opposed to relying on armed police as first responders), we could have increased the likelihood of a nonviolent de-escalation.\nFor these reasons, we demand the following from our city leaders:\n\nThe City of Newton must not rely solely on a District Attorney-led and police-led investigation of what happened on January 5th, but conduct their own independent investigation.

There has always been an interest in this extended family of raccoons, and in their well-being, and I had always hoped that their home territory would be a safe place for them to live their lives in peace. That was the case, until recently. The absolute cruelty directed toward these poor raccoons, apparently starting over the summer, and escalating into the fall and winter, is devastating, deeply disturbing, and absolutely heartbreaking.&nbsp; The four raccoons who have lost their right forelimbs will, hopefully, find a way to adapt to life without their right front paws and forelimbs, but their lives have become, in an instant, much more difficult.&nbsp; In addition, the matriarch and the young mother raccoons --&nbsp; both of whom have had an eye put out -- will, hopefully, find a way to adapt to life with only one eye, but their lives have become much more difficult as well.&nbsp; All of these raccoons should be allowed to live out their lives in their home territory, in peace, along with their kin, without danger of further human-perpetrated cruelty or abuse.\nDo these creatures not have the same right to live their lives on this earth as we do? Are the cruel and intentional maiming of these innocent creatures not injuries to us all?&nbsp; And, if we do not raise our voices and speak out against this unspeakable cruelty -- on behalf of poor, gentle, peaceful, and innocent creatures who have no voice -- who will?&nbsp; If we can find some hope in these raccoons' survival, if we can learn some lessons and find some meaning in their suffering, and if we might take steps to decrease potential future cruelty toward native wildlife mammals through the use of paw traps, and related ensnaring wildlife mammal traps, please let us work together toward those ends.\nPlease, go to your Amazon account, click on \"Customer Service,\" located near the top left of the top bar, then drop down to \"Need More Help,\" and click, and then scroll over to \"Contact Us,\" and click, and then scroll to \"Need more help by phone?&nbsp; We can call you,\" and click.&nbsp; Once you are connected to a call center representative, ask to speak with a supervisor.&nbsp; Please share your thoughts and feelings about the cruelty, barbarity, and inhumanity of paw traps, and your opinions about Amazon selling them.&nbsp; At the end of this call, ask specifically for a call-back and follow-up from an Amazon Executive Customer Relations Associate, both by phone and via email.

Currently we are in a hybrid learning setting where one day, half of the students go into school, and then the other day, the second half of students go into school. This hybrid learning setting has worked well. It may not be as normal as everyone would like it to be, but it is much better than 100% online.\nOne of the three indicators provided by the CDC on whether or not it is safe to go back in person for school is the number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 14 days. The most extreme category of this is more than 200 cases, and that is indicated as the highest risk of transmission in schools. Currently, from January 1-14, La Crosse county has 745 cases per 100,000 persons, almost four times the most extreme case.\nWhen the West Salem School Board decided to go back to in person school for five days a week, they changed the social distancing amount from six feet to three feet. They made this decision using information from a Harvard professor, not the CDC. This study, done by The Lancet, also concluded that for every three feet of additional space between two people, the chance of infection is reduced by 50%.\nWest Salem High School is not equipped to handle having all 500+ students and staff back into the same building. Currently, most students are not socially distant from each other, even three feet away, and teachers rarely enforce it. The study conducted by The Lancet uses face masks that are well fitted to each person in the study. This is not the case for students in West Salem. There are students in the building that have ill-fitting masks that do not cover their nose, or they downright refuse to wear it over their nose, which can cause students and staff to become easily infected.

School leaders know there is opportunity for improvement in racial equity in order to eliminate persistent racial gaps in performance and educational outcomes, racial disparities in discipline, and racialized opportunity gaps in the district. To that extent, and based on best practices being shared by leading systems about the methods for transforming a school, we petition Superintendent Asplen and the School Board to do the following:\n\nEstablish a Racial Equity and Inclusion Committee. We applaud the creation of the anti-racism task force in the district as well as the Superintendent Asplen\u2019s decision to bring together community leaders to address racism, inequity, and the achievement gap in the Sarasota County School District. We encourage the district\u2019s leadership to ensure that these efforts develop into a committee, holding an established place within the overall structure of the district that will oversee the development and implementation of a Sarasota County School District Anti-Racist Program.\nInvest in Anti-Racism and Implicit Bias Training. Require ongoing anti-racism and implicit bias training for all educators, school leaders, employees, administrators, and school board members in the district. Provide additional resources and opportunities for continuing education and the integration of anti-racist knowledge into policies at the district, school and classroom levels, including within curriculum and classroom interactions.\nRecruit and Retain BIPOC Educators, Administrators, and Staff. Establish hiring practices that accelerate the recruitment and retention of BIPOC educators, administrators, and staff. Studies have shown that having one Black educator in elementary school improves academic outcomes for black students, especially black males from working class backgrounds[1].\nInvest in the Development of Student Support Networks. Reallocate funding to increase the number of counselors, social workers and mental health workers, implementing and funding restorative justice, trauma responsive interventions, anti-racism, and intergroup dialogue programs in all schools. The ACLU reported that students in Florida schools, especially Black students, are more likely to interact with law enforcement rather than student support professionals like nurses, social workers, or psychologists[2]. Additionally, although only about 8% of Sarasota\u2019s students are Black, 23.4% of those referred to law enforcement in 2017[3] and 36% of those arrested in 2018 in our schools were Black[4].\nInstitute a Culturally Responsive and Anti-Racist Curriculum. With commitment and intentionality, provide resources for the development and implementation of culturally responsive and anti-racist curriculum for every subject at every grade level that includes age-appropriate educational material on the contributions, culture, and history of BIPOC groups. The Florida Legislature has mandated the teaching of African and African American History [F.S. 233.061 Sec. (1) (G) (1994) amended by F.S. 1003.42 (h) (2002)], [5]Florida curriculum standards also require teaching about racial and cultural diversity. We should follow these standards and require students to take a course focusing on the study of BIPOC peoples in order to graduate.\nEnsure Equitable Access to Educational Opportunities and Honors Programs. Create initiatives that ensure equitable access to all learning institutions, magnet programs, AP/IB courses, and other honors courses for students, and hire additional Black Educators and Educators of Color to teach those classes. Studies have also shown that even when taking performance on standardized tests into account, non-Black teachers are less likely to recommend black students for gifted programs[6].\n\nThe persistence of racism and racial inequality demand that the district develop a comprehensive anti-racism program that incorporates these items in the petition and other elements. These policies must be applied to all public schools as well as all charter and private schools that receive public money. The Sarasota County School District must act now so that all students can benefit from the districts wonderful educational resources.\nWe can be contacted via email at SRQAntiRacismCoalition@gmail.com.\nYou can find a full version of this petition at https://www.sarasotapeacenter.org/manasota-anti-racism-coalition\n[1] Gershenson, Seth, Cassandra M.

Expedient construction of the MPR was vital to avoid the use of portables, wasteful spending, and for our students to finish their elementary education at Spring Lake Elementary on a completed school campus. Despite the District and Board\u2019s awareness of the necessary timeline, and the funding for the MPR being available on June 30, 2018, no action to initiate construction of the MPR was taken until December of 2019. This 18-month delay resulted in WJUSD needing to bring in a portable/temporary MPR at the cost of $300,000. This cost was charged to our local Spring Lake Capital Facility Fund (CFF) which is funded by developer fees, is limited, and is intended to be used to BUILD schools in Spring Lake.\nCause for action:\nAt the upcoming January 14, 2021 WJUSD school board meeting, there will be a discussion regarding funding sources for the erection of additional portable/temporary structures for phase 3, the 5th and 6th-grade classrooms for the 2021-2022 school year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAction:\nWe are looking for community support to oppose using Spring Lake builder fees to pay for these portables, and instead pay for them from an alternative funding source.

Well, the investigation has shown as she traps them in small cages, saws the primates skulls open and mutilates their brain. She also terrifies them with spiders and snakes, which monkeys are terribly frightened by. Elisabeth Murray kills all the monkeys in her lab when she's done with them. Animals are living beings.

Regardless of how you have come to be in our lives, I am asking your help today on her behalf.\nOn the first business day of 2021, I was blindsided + served with a notice to \"Remove my Pig from Property\" within 30 days as a drafted amendment to my existing lease (which includes her).&nbsp; The sole reason I was given when asked why this was happening was that \"the broker heard the laws have recently changed and Long Beach no longer allows this\".&nbsp; When I requested the new city ordinance code - they failed to respond. When I contacted LBAC, they stated no revisions had been made to the existing laws in place, of which were consulted prior to bringing a mini pig onto this property. Thus negating their reasoning for this sudden demand. Free counsel was offered up to me by this community and has composed my responses and advised me to escalate this case to my District Council Woman, and furthermore put this case in front of City Council for their intervention - which I am actively doing now.&nbsp; \n*City Council Members - I have prepared a full information packet on mini-pigs; including all documents pertaining to this case, facts and definitions of different breed of swine, testimonials from the neighbors and Long Beach community, insight into Olive's life and home and yard here in Long Beach, and more. I have included a copy of it in my email to you. Thank you so much for your time and consideration of this case, especially during a global pandemic. \n*Let\u2019s be clear here on several important things*\n1. I have resided at this home for 6 years this month. I obtained verbal + written permission from the original Owner, who @ that time acted as Property Manager, who then drafted a new housing agreement explicitly covering her. Never would I bring an animal onto this property without getting full permission first. More importantly, she is a certified ESA animal with permission to be here. Her ESA documentation supersedes any zoning regulations as per long as 3 criteria are met, which they certainly are.\n2. Pages 18-19 of my current lease are the Pet Addendum which reflect all pets, including pig. #18 states that in the event of default by Resident (me) of any of the above terms resident agrees within 3 days after receiving written notice default from Landlord, to cure the default or vacate premises. Resident agrees landlord may revoke permission to keep said pet by giving resident 30 days notice in writing\u201d. No default was made or even given as the reason. Nor was this listed as the reason.\n3. Law that stands today as per LB Animal Control website is ambiguous and uses the verbiage \u201chog\u201d in paragraph one as the ONLY and sole reference to any swine related creature. There are several factors to take into consideration in regards to my said mini-pig, Olive Garden.\n* She is an actual Emotional Support Animal, of whom is of service to me daily. She has an official ESA certification from my Long Beach based Doctor + Therapist, who have treated me since 2019.\n* As the handler of an emotional support animal, I meet the definition of disabilityunder the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Under California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Government Code Sections 12955-12956.2) and, for rental housing, under Unruh Civil Rights Act (Unruh Act) (Civil Code Section 51) and Disabled Persons Act (CDPA) (Civil Code Sections 54.1 and 54.2), as well as under federal law in the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) (42 U.S.C.\n* She is a certified - with papers from an official breeder that she was purchased from 5.5 years ago - to be a \u201cTEACUP PIG aka Micro Pig aka Juliana Pig (official breed name per Vet records). A hog or a boar (interchangeable), usually referred to as a farm hog - has an entirely different genetic makeup, is HUNDREDS of pounds heavier than a Juliana, have strong tusks, and are raised on a different diet for food.\n* Juliana pigs (aka mini-pigs, teacup pigs, Vietnamese potbellied pigs) are solely bred for companionship and lab testing, along with BEAGLES.\n*Most sanctuaries won't take in mini-pigs as hogs can accidentally hurt/kill them when challenging for dominance.\nShe\u2019s VERY full grown at 5.5 years/of a 9 year lifespan, and is 85 LBS now, so its safe to say she is the breed that the breeder sold her to be when sold to her original family (I have all paperwork). She has lived more than half her life expectancy.&nbsp; It is cruel and inhumane to expect me to just give up or terminate a member of my FAMILY while being at the epicenter of a global PANDEMIC. Of which this region is affected the most in the world right now.\nWhere is she supposed to go? Where am I supposed to go if I choose not to forfeit her? During a lock down order in LA County and under a pandemic?\n4. She is already here ONSITE, with a large, private and beautifully kept yard space that all neighbors have approved (and all have written testimonials on her behalf), and has resided here for almost 1.5 years with NO conflicts. She has NEVER broken a single measure in the legally binding Pet Addendum, which the Broker is now attempting to bully me over.\n5. Olive Garden was spayed, de-tusked, micro chipped, + vaccinated by the city of Long Beach. Her D.V.M. (a Pig Specialist) is here. She knows over 20 commands, NEVER leaves this property (though is fully capable and able to walk on a harness and leash).&nbsp; She is happy, safe and content in the confines of this private yard - of which I pay for.&nbsp; She lives with her 2 chicken best friends and they are deeply bonded.\n6. She is the mascot \u201cKLBP-ig\u201d to Long Beach Public Radio here. I am also a member of the community and I will not give her up. Thus, should this unethical demand that was handed down to me not be amended then my entire life will also be impacted and uprooted. I am an on-air radio DJ with Long Beach Public Radio, I am a Yoga Teacher + Yoga Therapist in this community! I value the life I have built in Long Beach and hope to continue to reside here, alongside my ESA.\n7. The reason she landed here initially is because clearly, another family made a very difficult choice to relinquish her, to leave her with a person they trusted of whom would provide her space and companionship. I have more than met their expectations and was given their trust at that time, most of all by the 13 year old who RAISED HER for years. Imagine how hard of a decision that probably was for a child to make? How brave it was to make a choice in her best interest...? So to unnecessarily re home her again?? Unconscionable.\n&nbsp;\nI am now asking the City of Long Beach to exercise the same emotional depth and capacity that this 13 year old did, when she made the choice to let me take over Olive's care. For a better LIFE.\nAT THE VERY LEAST - THIS IS AN ANIMAL WELFARE ISSUE!!!!!!\nShow me one option that improves her welfare by doing this to her?\nShelters are CLOSED!! At capacity!!\n** Most sanctuaries won\u2019t take her because she is not a farm hog but a Juliana micro pig and aside from that this is a pandemic - sanctuaries are shutting down left and right, dealing with tons of people who have been evicted and gave up their pets, there is no space! Not to mention the welfare of her should be the top priority! This would cause so much stress and anguish for this animal.\n&nbsp;\nThis would be a different conversation and battle to contest should I have\n1. Failed to obtained permission from proper parties prior to arrival to even \"visit\"\n2. Violated any form of my housing agreement\n3. If Olive had done anything wrong that would fall under default as per lease. (ex. biting someone, not having space, food or sufficient water, failing to be spayed, non vaccinated, leaving the space dirty and unclean, etc.)\n4. This conversation should not even be happening as Olive is not a pet but a certified Emotional Support Animal. Further inquiry is against the law and to be further challenged and threatened on this is considered Discrimination.\n&nbsp;\nFACTS ABOUT MINI PIGS\n*Pigs use the bathroom in private and then cover it up completely once a day! They are famously clean animals who hate to be dirty.\n*They also do not have sweat glands so don\u2019t perspire or have an odor at all, prior to contrary belief.\n*Pigs are the 3rd smartest species in the AK, and have the emotional intelligence and sensitivity of a 3 year old toddler.\n* All pigs though, are deeply sensitive and can die from stress or a \u201cbroken heart\u201d. Stories have reflected these facts, especially in \u201cre homing situations where the family has to surrender their beloved animal suddenly\u201d. This animal is superior to a dog in emotional intelligence and cannot just be \u201cremoved from the premises\u201d as per the wording in this notice.\n*When Olive was given outdoor space for first time in her life arriving here to my yard she began to burst into \"zoomies\" daily. Zoomies are a quick sprint pigs do to show trust and joy.\nMore with Olive the Pig:\nASMR Youtube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YTEG6Ir4YQ&amp;t=210s\nInstagram:\n@OliveGardenThePig\nLBAC \"Law:\nhttp://www.longbeach.gov/acs/pet-laws-and-licensing/livestock/\n&nbsp;\nSUMMARY:\nIn conclusion, I will not be surrendering my Emotional Support Animal, of whom is a member of this family and my medicine. I broke no laws, I included and involved everyone who was involved with this property at that time 2 years ago, and I have since remained transparent with present tense employees and new people in the mix within management. As recently as 3 weeks ago all parties were at my home and happily visiting with Olive Garden, openly commenting on her happiness within this space.\nI do believe my beloved community, of which I am apart of and this awesome City of Long Beach will be able to make a final conclusion here and I believe they will do the right thing on behalf of me and my Emotional Support Animal pig and allow her/us to stay in our home where we have always remained, uneventful.\nIf this story touches you, and/or if you have had an experience with Olive, please feel free to contribute a testimonial on her behalf. I am overwhelmed by the outcry and support we have received from our friends over this near and far!\nThis is cruel and inhumane to do this, and would cause serious trauma both to this animal and myself.\nKeep 'em coming, it's never enough to build her case to keep her SAFE and in her HOME.\nDO THE RIGHT THING, LBC!!!! \nAnne + Olive\n*City Council Members - I have prepared a full information packet on mini-pigs; including all documents pertaining to this case, facts and definitions of different breed of swine, testimonials from the neighbors and Long Beach community, insight into Olive's life and home and yard here in Long Beach, and more. I have included a copy in my email to you.

They will never get this time back- these are once in a lifetime experiences - and this is having a detrimental effect on their emotional well-being.&nbsp;\nAs mentioned, many of us are veteran hockey parents.&nbsp; We have and will continue to abide by any requirements for face masks and social distancing.&nbsp; We are abiding by these guidelines currently, in attending other events at Foxboro Sports Center as well as other rinks.&nbsp; To not honor those requirements would put the season, and our children\u2019s passion, at risk.&nbsp;\nThe CDC, MA Hockey, and the MIAA have established guidelines for safe attendance at these high school sporting events that adhere to social distancing guidelines established by our state government.\nThere is absolutely no health risk to our student athletes or community by allowing spectators at Foxboro hockey home games.\nAgain, we thank you for your commitment to our student athletes, and trust that with additional reflection and the support of this petition, you will change the current policy of no spectators at hockey home games.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/ra/mq/ecramQCCNHKIZom-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610316142"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/people-extend-eviction-moratorium-and-support?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Extend Eviction Moratorium and Support", "description": "Extend and Support a Wisconsin Eviction Moratorium\nFebruary 1st will be a traumatic day for thousands of Wisconsinites. When the CDC Moratorium on evictions is lifted on January 31st, some 35,700-75,500 Wisconsin households will face housing disruption or eviction filings. What will follow will not be the happy end of 2020 we all anticipated, but another year of economic devastation, COVID sickness and death, and despair.\nThe three moratoriums we\u2019ve seen in Wisconsin have mitigated economic disaster. In April, some 415,557 people were unemployed, a 400% increase from March, when COVID first hit. During the moratoriums, people have found work without worry of payments or evictions, with just 156,549 people unemployed in November. However, this progress will evaporate when the millions in rental debt is due and thousands of renters are evicted, hurting all of us\u2014renter and landlord, urban and rural.\nEvictions will also increase COVID sickness and death. The lifting of state moratoriums across the country last year resulted in 433,700 new cases and 10,700 deaths. This is likely to be even worse given that the new B.1.1.7 variant is 50-70% more transmissible than the original virus.\nShamefully, despite these ongoing and impending crises, our state legislators have done nothing. They haven\u2019t passed a single piece of legislation in more than 8 months. That\u2019s why&nbsp; we need our mayors and city council members to step up\u2014calling on state legislators to act and promoting local solutions. Specifically, we call upon our local leaders to:\n&nbsp;\n1. Provide government financial assistance to help all Wisconsin renters pay off all outstanding rental debts (i.e. The Right to Shelter Fund).\n2. Provide rental assistance to tenants and small landlords moving forward to help ensure renters do not subsequently accrue debts, and to help small landlords get by with little to no revenue streams. This funding can be modeled off of Governor Evers\u2019 $25,000,000 Wisconsin Rental Assistance Program which used CARES Act funding to provide rent and security deposits to landlords on behalf of tenants who qualified.Cancel accruing late payment fees. Not only do these fees add to the sum total of debt, but they also, in effect, penalize tenants monthly for failing to pay, even if they want to and are unable.\n3. Provide dedicated case-by-case support to tenants who have been evicted in the last nine months. Although the moratoriums have prevented many people from being evicted, 800-3,000 households have nonetheless been evicted per month, depending on the relevant moratorium. For example, the CARES Act saw 2,300-2,400 households evicted in Wisconsin monthly due to its narrow federal mortgage qualifications, in contrast to the some 800 households evicted per month during Governor Evers\u2019 moratorium.\n4. Publicize and spread the details of the moratorium as much as possible, working with partner organizations, activists, and courts to ensure as many people as possible are aware of the status of their debts, future payments, and legal challenges. In particular, make it a priority to inform as many BIPOC and low-income households as possible are aware of the moratorium and its implications.Call on the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) to provide regulatory protections against landlords gouging rental prices for renters who are able (as well as those not able) to pay.&nbsp;\nWe all want 2021 to be a new chapter, but if we continue to do nothing or take insufficient steps to delay our problems, 2021 may be even worse yet than last year.

We are living through a crisis. Now is NOT the time to be devoting any money or energy to high-stakes admissions tests that were deeply problematic before the pandemic.\nSHSAT\nThe problems with the SHSAT are well documented. Despite comprising nearly 70% of the student population citywide, Black and Latinx students make up just 10% of students admitted to specialized high schools. About 71% of city students are economically disadvantaged, but at specialized high schools, only 40% are. The racial and socioeconomic disparities are the direct result of the SHSAT, a multiple choice test that significantly advantages students who attend \"feeder\" middle schools which disproportionately exclude Black and Latinx students and whose families invest thousands of dollars into test prep.\nSHSAT testing is scheduled to begin in late January. The city must call it off!\nG&amp;T\nBig racial disparities also exist in Gifted and Talented programs, of which Black and Latinx students make up just 22%. At the age of four and five students are required to prove their intelligence to test into a more rigorous and resourced educational experience. Getting into G&amp;T requires a one-on-one examination with a teacher, leaving no room for social distancing and continuing to endanger our teachers who have worked so hard through such difficult and uncertain times. A test of \u201cintelligence\u201d at age 4 is actually a test of privilege.\nOn January 27, the Panel for Education Policy votes on a $1.7M contract with Pearson to administer the G&amp;T exam this year.

Lakes, rivers, and oceans are currently at the risk of being over contaminated, which increases year after year. This problem is much more serious than expected. Plastic pollution literary means a dangerous impact on human\u2019s health, marine life, and the conditions on the existing ecosystems of the planet as a whole.\nThe biggest problem of such pollution lies not in the drinks bottles or plastic cups thrown away, but in the plastic microbeads, or microplastic. They are the tiny pieces hardly seen by the naked eye that are produced by the plastic itself being in its structure. When getting to the global oceans, the plastic particles can be spread all over the globe with the currents of the wind. Such particles may be different in various cases but usually they consist of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). They have been used by the companies that produce cosmetics, hygiene products such as soaps, toothpastes, body washes, etc. Billions of people use them every single day several times per twenty-four hours, which causes great damage to the water on Earth and gets back to humans through seafood like fish as well as oysters, or even sea salt. For example, the fish that people harvest and use in the dishes like sushi. It happens because fish absorbs the micro-plastic particles in a significant number that gets deep into their tissues. As a result, humans absorb microplastic they waste themselves back while eating fish.\n&nbsp;\nPlastic also causes death to most marine habitants like turtles, dolphins, whales simply because they confuse plastic with food. Turtles do not feel the difference between jellyfish and a plastic bag, so after absorption animals feel blockades inside and their organisms cannot recycle them. It breaks the digestive system, which is fatal also for the sea birds.\nWith the longevity of plastics in oceans for over hundreds or even thousands of years, its number increases day by day while it is washed up along coastlines, in the process of industrial activity, or during storms.\n&nbsp;\nThe recent studies conducted by the team of analysts from the UK revealed that within just the last year the level of pollution reached the crisis point in the river Tame, near Manchester. Currently this is the highest level of contamination the region ever seen. It was caused by the winter floods that happened back in 2015-2016. As a result, the concentration of the microplastic participles surpassed the data of the previous results. This means that oceans\u2019 level of pollution has also significantly increased and keeps on getting higher by the minute.\nIn 2015, Barack Obama banned the use of microfibers in the personal care products in the USA by signing the Microbeads Free Waters Act. This gave other countries a boost to ban microbeads too. In January 2018, such microbeads were forbidden also in the UK. According to the environment minister in the UK, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, ban of microbeads was one of the most effective ways to try to save the world\u2019s oceans anyway people can. The same thought is supported by Mary Creagh MP, EAC chair, adding that producers of the coffee-cups must be responsible for their own products and this idea must be supported by government.\nNowadays many countries including poor ones or from the developed world, try to solve the global problem of pollution by separation of plastic waste and recycling, or using alternatives for plastic products whenever possible. In Europe, for instance, in 2014 the amount of plastic waste surpassed the percent that was recycled \u2013 only 30% of over 25 million tones of plastic waste. This means that the rest of plastic and its particles were thrown into environment.\n&nbsp;\nHowever, there are other ways that can solve the problem of pollution like awareness of the society. The Grantham Institute at Imperial College London offered in their report in 2016 that there\u2019s a necessity to consider plastic as a valuable source of the new material as a result of recycling. This may increase the economic value of plastic waste.\nFurther conditions of the plastic pollution depend on the countries that society lives in and attention of the government to this big problem. For over 60-70 years that plastic exists, the contamination of the planet has increased to the large numbers and we will need a lot of time and effort to save nature and decrease the impact of plastic on ecosystems and us, humans. Currently it seems impossible because with every passing moment another portion of plastic is utilized and only a little part of it is recycled. However, there is a hope for solving this problem while humans become more conscious and over time the problem might get smaller scale.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/ul/py/OqULPYumhzTcXdf-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610639171"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/marsha-blackburn-and-billl-hagerty-to-resign-from-us-senatety-for-marsha-blackburn-and-bill-hagerty-to-resign-from-the-us-senate?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "For Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty to Resign from the US Senate", "description": "Give Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty should both resign from the US Senate, because of their support of Donald Trump and violence they both helped cause in DC on January 6, 2020.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/nx/ae/eMnXAeWhINyfCTr-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610078150"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/the-walt-disney-company-keep-disney-s-magical-express?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Keep Disney\u2019s Magical Express", "description": "Who doesn\u2019t look forward to planning their next Disney World vacation?

Norma Alcala, who shares the same goals of increased transparency and civic participation as Martha, was also sworn in. That leaves two remaining city council members, both quite vocal in their support for the previous mayor, who are in opposition to Martha\u2019s desire to take a more inclusive stance and see her seat filled by the application process which has long been the tradition for the city.&nbsp;\nMartha, an original supporter of the previous mayor, made no secret of her concerns for the direction of the city feeling that things had reached a tipping point where the infrastructure of the city was becoming less and less a priority. She launched each of her bids for public office citing a need for more attention placed on addressing homelessness, affordable housing options, infrastructure, and making the city safer.&nbsp;\nSo how can we, as West Sacramentans, support our newly elected mayor? With a current 2:2 split, we need an appointment process that opens up the field to choose someone who supports the vision and ideals we voted for when we elected Martha to lead our city. We need to appoint someone who can place their loyalty to the working class people of the city above politics-someone who cares about improving access to city services and supporting our long-underserved communities. We need a critical thinker who shares our new mayor\u2019s commitment to accessibility, transparency and who will support moving to a city council of single member district representation.\nAt the December 9th city council meeting, there was a push to make a direct appointment of the city council candidate who came in 3rd in a two seat election to fill Martha\u2019s seat instead of opening up the process to the entire city through the application process. This candidate, unlike the other two in the race who placed 4th and 5th, ran on a slate with the previous mayor as did the candidate who placed 1st in the two seat race.&nbsp;\nMany feel that a direct appointment of the 3rd place candidate is owed to her supporters. But what is owed to 52% of the electorate who voted for a change in the mayor and by extension a change in the direction of the city? The math of a direct appointment paints a clear picture and one that was rejected by 52% of the electorate.&nbsp;\nPlease join me and sign this petition to show&nbsp;our city council that what is desired and what is needed, is an open and inclusive process to fill the vacant seat. We cannot have that unless we have an open application process. Politics and personal bias must be put aside to do what is best for the people of West Sacramento. Only then will we be able to appoint someone to the council who shares our values.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/iu/eo/zrIUEoUsGgsAsAu-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610067528"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/humana-and-health-care-service-corporation-health-insurance-accepted-for-massage-therapy?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Health insurance accepted for Massage Therapy", "description": "These are some dire times especially during this pandemic.

As an animal lover and owner, I am horrified that creatures as smart and as large as whales are ripped from their families and kept in aquariums. Before you come at me for being hypocritical, I rescued two animals, provide for my animals immensely, and my animals were bred as domesticated animals not suited for the wild. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Orcas stay with their families, side by side, for their entire lives. And yet we, as humans, think it is acceptable to strip this custom from these giant mammals and turn them into circus animals, performing twice a day, everyday, for their entire lives. This is disgusting. Beyond inhumane. As we have seen the repercussions of holding these animals captive, and have seen that orcas are friendly to humans in their natural habitat, it should be a no-brainer to release these animals and let them live their natural lives in the ocean. I am sickened by Seaworld and all other amusement parks holding these highly intelligent, emotional, and cultured whales prisoner for money and entertainment. How is this still accepted and allowed?? What a disgraceful practice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not only orcas, but all mammals whose lives should be lived in the wild. I\u2019m not even getting started on gorillas, elephants, hippos, etc. Never have I felt more uneasy viewing animals, then when I went to Omaha Zoo and saw the gorillas sitting, empty and defeated, as we humans gawked at these majestic animals. This is just not right, and the owners of these types of \u201camusement parks\u201d know what they are doing is wrong and are feeding the public the idea that this is how we \u201cappreciate\u201d these animals. This is no way to admire them, it is all about money. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we wanted to appreciate them, we would observe and record them in their natural habitats as exemplified correctly by Jane Goodall in the 60\u2019s. We should seek to put an end to zoos or aquariums enslaving animals whose lives would be better off free. It is different if these animals are with deformity or illness that prevents them from surviving in the wild. That is something I appreciated at the Shedd Aquarium, as many of their fish were not able to safely return to the wild, as they would quickly become food.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is disturbing how captivity and forced labor of these beasts still continue today. We need to end this. Have we no empathy?

Whitestone Boulevard (northwest corner of Anderson Mill and 1431) from regional office/retail/commercial to heavy commercial and a rezoning of the property from general business to light industrial.\nThe proposal calls for a 98,000 sq ft Amazon warehouse and distribution center with 170 general parking spaces, 370 van spaces, and 40 loading spots to accommodate 18-wheel trucks. The current zoning was approved by the Cedar Park City Council in its 2014 Comprehensive Plan.\nThe potentially impacted neighborhoods recognize the value Amazon could bring to the Cedar Park tax base and community, but oppose the proposed rezoning and warehouse and distribution center in this particular location for multiple reasons:\nSites already exist elsewhere with the desired designation/zoning for Amazon\u2019s&nbsp;proposed operations\n\nOther sites in Cedar Park are already designated for heavy commercial and zoned for light industrial zoning \u2014 including along the 183A corridor and farther away from residential neighborhoods \u2014 that would be more appropriate for this type of warehouse and distribution center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTraffic in west Cedar Park is already congested, and rezoning would make it worse\n\nThe Amazon proposal calls for more than 550 parking spots to accommodate the constant stream of 18-wheelers, 150 delivery vans \u2014 up to 370 in peak seasons \u2014 and employees and contract drivers who will be using Anderson Mill Road, which serves as a primary entrance to both Whitestone Oaks and Carriage Hills subdivisions. This would bring additional traffic stress and additional safety issues to an area already facing major transportation capacity concerns. Traffic in the vicinity is already a major challenge. Expansion of 1431 is not planned for at least another 3-5 years, and does not address the additional complications a 24-hour distribution center would bring to Anderson Mill Road and nearby neighborhoods.&nbsp;\n\nRezoning&nbsp;could impair possibilities for redeveloping the quarry and the area at large\n\nThe Cedar Park City Council has not yet held public hearings on the findings of the feasibility study and possibilities for the 216-acre Lime Creek Quarry on the south side of 1431. Any change in zoning on the west side of Cedar Park should take into consideration the redevelopment potential of the quarry rather than limit it. The visions for east and central Cedar Park are becoming clear with development plans for Indigo Ridge and the Bell Boulevard Project, respectively. The greater vision for west Cedar Park should be discussed before spot rezoning in a vacuum creates a slippery slope and risks the gateway to the Hill Country not reflecting the high standards exemplified in the vision for the rest of Cedar Park.&nbsp;\n\nThe proposed rezoning is not good for the surrounding residents and neighborhood. It is not good for the vision of west Cedar Park. And it is not good for Cedar Park overall. We ask the Cedar Park Planning &amp; Zoning Commission to reject this rezoning and encourage Amazon to choose another, more suitable location for its warehouse and distribution center.\nPlease sign the petition to tell the Cedar Park Planning &amp; Zoning Commission and the Cedar Park City Council to reject this rezoning and encourage Amazon to choose another, more suitable location for its warehouse and distribution center.

The petitioner, Erik Nikkel, of Casey\u2019s Retail Company, Ankeny, Iowa, wants to build a Casey\u2019s General Store and Gas Station at this location.\nTo be clear, we are not against the commercial use of this property, formerly Smith Brother\u2019s Landscaping. We are specifically against a gas station for the following reasons:\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At just under 2.2 acres, the property is too small to accommodate a development of this size. There are larger parcels of land located closer to the Interstate 80 corridor better suited for a gas station, and there are better business options \u2013 local ones \u2013 of a more appropriate scale which could be put at this location.\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The property is immediately adjacent to the following: an Animal Hospital; a ravine/run-off creek that drains directly into Hickory Creek and then the Des Plaines River; an older unincorporated residential neighborhood (Lincolnwood Hills) in a flood plane where residents rely on well water, often with wells below modern code standards. Numerous studies cited herein establish the dangers of underground storage tanks (USTs).\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorporation of this property does not benefit the residents of Lincolnwood Hills. Tax revenue generated by a gas station \u2013 negligible at best \u2013 benefits the village of New Lenox, while the people immediately adjacent to the gas station are left with the fumes, light and noise pollution, effluence, traffic congestion, property devaluation, and crime.

The following questions need to be addressed:\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are 2 new gas stations needed within the 3 mile stretch when there are 5 others already there? What studies show the local economy can sustain 2 gas stations and not leave the area with an eyesore and unsupervised storage tanks if one folds?\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blueprints in the proposal do not show how many USTs there are to be, nor where.\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will wells/drinking water be protected?\nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are the studies about noise, traffic, pollution, impact on groundwater, and impact on sewer/stormwater in this low flooding area?\ne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the proposal in compliance with Fire Marshal Code Section 175.430 -Clearance Required for USTs:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distance to Basements.

My conviction was based off false testimony from three States key witnesses: the victim\u2019s mother Aja McBayne, Dr. Palmer child pediatrician, and Dr. Mileusnic medical examiner; ineffective counsel; unfair and partial bias in due process from Judge Blackwood; an unrelated incident from my childhood that was ruled an accidental death but used as character assassination in the local media and prosecutor; and undue influence from former Knox County Commissioner Rudy Dirl, his wife is the grandmother of Jo-Jo.\nThe state theory was I took Jo-Jo to the back bedroom to beat and choke him to death. They also used that same narrative to find me guilty twice and my direct appeal. There is NO physical evidence suggested that I committed this crime.&nbsp; The following factors influenced the outcome of my case and denied appeal.\n\nMy attorney failed to present a defense. This, despite the fact he had the benefit of having the trial transcript of my first trail. Specifically, he knew that Aja was&nbsp;the State's key witness and had been charged as a co-defendant in the case. After Aja direct testimony, my attorney failed to raise the issue and never attempted to cross-examine her&nbsp;about the dismissed charges and why she changed her story serval times to fit the state narrative. Some point prior to trial, the State agreed to dismiss all charges against Aja and use&nbsp;her as a witness. The State stated to the Court as one of their bases for&nbsp;dismissing the charges, that Ms. Aja had successfully completed a polygraph test that&nbsp;indicated that she had nothing to do with Jo-Jo injuries or subsequent death. My attorney was never notified that Aja was subjected to a polygraph test, nor was my counsel invited to attend, provided the questions asked and results or provided an opportunity to&nbsp;conduct his own polygraph test. Aja was also allowed to testify that she had no promises&nbsp;from the ADA in exchange for her testimony. The State&nbsp;failed to provide all the information regarding the purported polygraph tests to my attorney&nbsp;prior to trial to allow me the opportunity to have the information reviewed by&nbsp;its own experts or to conduct its own polygraph tests.\nMy attorney failed to investigate witness, Aja and her complete criminal history, her history of drug use, prior Department of Children's Services complaints, and other relevant information. A more thorough investigation would have revealed that she had a history of drug abuse, that Jo-Jo had a history of suspicious injuries suffered while in the care and custody of Aja prior to having any contact with me. As a result of not having the case thoroughly investigated, no proper timeline of my relationship with Aja was established, no proper time periods were established for when I would have had the opportunity to cause the injuries, no witnesses were interviewed that would have established the prior suspicious injury history of Jo-Jo prior to any contact with me.\nMark Stephens represented me on the appeal. Mr. Stephens never met with me to discuss the issues presented on my appeal. On my appeal the only issues&nbsp;that were raised were the admission of the autopsy and hospital photographs; improperly&nbsp;restricting the cross-examination of Aja; and failure of the State to make an&nbsp;election of offenses. Mr. Stephens failed to raise the crying of Dr. Palmer&nbsp;during her testimony, comments by Dr. Mileusnic about photograph not in evidence,&nbsp;introduction of evidence related to injuries which occurred prior to the alleged date of the&nbsp;offense, failing to give a jury instruction related to how Aja\u2019s prior convictions could&nbsp;be used to assess her credibility, allowing the autopsy report that had been introduced for&nbsp;identification only to be marked as an exhibit and given to the jury during deliberations, allowing&nbsp;the jury to view unredacted medical reports, and failing to instruct the jury on the State's failure to preserve evidence.\nAs part of their investigation, the Knoxville Police Department did not visit my house (alleged crime scene) at any time. Lead Det. Debra Nuchols lied under oath and said I confessed to the crime which that never happened. Judge Blackwood was seen on several occasions during the trial engaged in extended and&nbsp;protracted conversations with Rudy Dirl. Serval witnesses saw Judge Blackwood hugging Aja during my trial.

The city of Chicago has given him awards and promotions with a salary over $107,000 to do it to our communities. He\u2019s been unprofessional for years Detective Forberg have 38 allegations and complaints against him and only one suspension. That's is the definition of systemic racism, abuse, torture that has been covered up by Chicago Police in our communities. These Detectives have committed crimes against our communities.On July 21, 2012 there was an argument with Roshone Eldridge (victim) and several neighborhood men about kids shooting Roshone's truck with a bb gun (none of the kids belong to me nor did I know the victim). After attending two funerals, I returned to Minnesota to assist in my mother medical care. I was trying to give my mom a kidney to&nbsp; save her life. I was arrested on (now) an illegal investigated alert on 8/7/12. When I returned to Chicago on 8/29/12 I was put in a lineup of four people (against police policy). Then a line-up consists of 5-6 people usually one is the suspect while the others maybe police officers or decoys, who bear a resemblance to the suspect or fit the description that the eye witnesses gave to the police and there is no requirement that all men placed in a line up must be physically identical, if not too Great are of little consequence. a claim that there were significant differences between the ages, size and appearances of the suspect and the other line up participants goes to weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. For one at the time of the lineup I was 35 years of age and not one participant was the same age. Second, I'm light skinned not one was light skinned. Third, I had a low haircut and others participants had dreadlocks and small afros. That's Great Now Detective Forberg question witnesses at Asel Food together at the same time and showed them a single photo of prior to the photo array, before the lineup. I know this because Judge Timothy J Joyce ask one of the witnesses did Detective Forberg show him and his brother that single photo of me before or after the photo array and line up, the witness stated that was the first picture Detective Forberg showed them at Asel Foods.\nDetective Forberg committed perjury on the stand on 8/4/17 when my attorney asks him about a witness statement she made about describing the shooters (plural) as 16-35 years of age and wearing a black T-shirt, Forberg testified that the witness description was a typo. Detective Forberg was the lead detective and responsible for the contents of his reports and was familiar with the original case incident report and its contents.\nOn May 5/30/17 the first day of trial, the State gave my attorney new evidence of a man named Joseph Grant who was arrested approximately 3-4 months after the incident for possession of the same firearm used in the 7/21/12 incident. Detective Forberg never investigated this suspect, never investigated the arresting officers of Joseph grant about the firearm. I was consequently given 20 years for for the same weapon and 6 years for discharging that weapon. ( I have never been in possession of this weapon and Joseph Grant actually served time for the same weapon he was charge with having)&nbsp; Also 3 witnesses stated that saw me doing the shooting, but there was a Detective Watson who said it was two shooters and never was none of this in my Discovery but there is a phone log of Detective Watson form ISP. On 8/3/12 the R/D's requested Illinois State Police Crime Labs to examine the recovered firearm evidence to determine whether one or more firearms had been used in the shooting. The R/D's were informed that same day that testing had determined that at least two firearms had been used in the shooting and ISP forensic Scientist Jennifer Sher determined that twelve casings were fired from a Glock type pistol and four casings were fired from a different firearm.\nMy jury waiver in this case was invalid because it was made without knowing all the evidence against me at the time he executed the waiver. Under Illinois law I had the right to know what the evidence was when I waived my right to a jury trial. I faced extreme prejudice because the state failed to disclose the evidence against me before trial. It has long been established that where the government knows or should have known that it's witness testimony is false or misleading, the government has an obligation to correct such testimony and if prosecutor knowingly permits false testimony to be used, the defendant (me) is entitled to a new trial. \"The duty of a public prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict?? Using false testimony to help obtain a conviction violates a defendant's due process rights. And prosecutor knowingly permitted false testimony to be used when she allowed states witnesses to testify that there was a street light on the corner of 5700 S Sangamon was present on the day of the homicide July 21, 2012. The state enters into evidence to show a street light pole on the southwest corner of the intersection and the state show a google maps that indicated that the photo was from November of 2015, more than three years after the incident took place. The state failed to correct the false testimony and evidence in which they presented, that the street light on the southwest corner was not actually there when the shooting took place and the Crime scene technicians photographs from the incident taken shortly after clearly showing there wasn't a street light pole here and in addition to the prosecutor's failure to correct the false testimony she had a duty to correct the false testimony. Illinois has incorporated this concept into its rules of Professional Conduct.\nChicago is a city of a long history of corrupt and racist policing and high ranking officers with violent past have continue to enjoy long and decorated careers meanwhile, people like me languish in prison because of patterns of misconduct from Detectives Forberg and Detective Eberle. If these so call award getting good cops done the job the right way and not using bogus patterns and practice and criminal tactics of fabricating evidence and committing perjury to tip the scales of Justice would have ended a Not Guilty verdict for me, that seriously affected the fairness and integrity.\nPlease understand my position I have been found guilty of a crime I did not commit but Illinois would rather stay wrong than admit that it had been wrong and had been UNJUST.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/sp/ip/mNspiPxevZxAQHN-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610755536"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/congress-ephs-young-democrats-petition-to-the-rhode-island-delegation?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "EPHS Young Democrats Petition to The Rhode Island Delegation", "description": "The Young Democrats Club of East Providence High School were deeply disturbed by the actions committed at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nIn light of this event, we want to call on the Rhode Island Delegation and their colleagues in the House of Representatives and the Senate to;&nbsp;\n\nLabel those that attacked the Capitol as domestic terrorists.&nbsp;\nHold elected officials, at all levels of government, accountable for the words and rhetoric that stoked the riots on January 6th, 2021.\nEnsure that those domestic terrorists who engaged in the attack are found and charged to the fullest extent of the law by encouraging the new Attorney General and the incoming Biden Administration to take any necessary action.&nbsp;\nConduct an investigation into why the National Guard was not deployed sooner and why the Capitol Police were not prepared for this event, despite advanced and legitimate intelligence of such a threat.\n&nbsp;Encourage all elected officials, for the purpose of precedent, to support&nbsp; articles of impeachment against President Trump for his role in inciting the violence at our nation\u2019s Capital.\n\nWhat happened on January 6th was an attempted coup by armed insurrectionists.

Additionally, law enforcement would have a powerful tool in their toolbox to help identify who was directly responsible for a murder.&nbsp; We believe this reform would create a more proportional and equitable sentencing in Minnesota, while serving public safety by holding those who harm or kill accountable for their actions. This reform would give the courts and judges the ability to convict and sentence people according to the actual crimes they committed.\nWe will push for these Reforms to be made retroactive. This would allow for anyone currently serving a sentence under any Felony Murder law in Minnesota to apply for a review and resentencing of their case.

Some of my friends even started leagues in it.&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon there was an update.&nbsp; An update that many people didn't like. The kicking was harder, they rested all stats so people had to climb up the global board again. I mean sure it gave other people a chance to become global but the kicking wasn't the same. It was so hard. For some time not many people could make a kick at all. The PAT was No good and field goals were No good. Soon people got used to it. They changed the power here and there but it wasn't anything we couldn't get used to.\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then on January 15, 2021 we had another update and this update was not something were happy about at all. people were even madder about this update than the kicking change update. They made pump fake that you have to click two times and the throwing was slightly delayed. So if your trying to throw a quick slant its likely to be intercepted. The worst part was that they buffed the dive. You only dove like less than one yard. You couldn't even throw a dime properly and it was hard to intercept and it was already hard to intercept. Many people are mad about this including me.\nXstns said \"--Pump fake control changed from Q to more intuitive double click --The throw animation is a few milliseconds longer nbd just make sure your aim follows through --Replaced 'reset camera' button with 'teleport to practice' --Added command /ballCam for spectating in VIPs --Tried to fix glitching out the locker room --Dive: Hopefully fixed issues for mac users --Dive: Overhauled to be less ridiculous looking, no flipping around, and the jump-dive is a bit weaker.

I am a 2017 University of Massachusetts graduate who had the wonderful opportunity of playing on the UMass Tennis Team from 2014-2017. I am writing to you today to express the mutual frustration and sorrow that becomes of myself and teammates who were on the team during this time period.&nbsp;\nNone of us believe that we are an exception to the rules. However, we do believe that we have the right to be treated fairly and justly in accordance with all other athletes and universities. The decision of the Committee of Infractions per the NCAA states that because of a mistake that was self-reported by the University of Massachusetts, women\u2019s tennis would lose all two years (2015/16 and 2016/17) of victories including the women\u2019s tennis A10 Championship among other penalties.&nbsp;\nUMass did the right thing by reporting the financial mistake. The mistake was that the students who lived off-campus received some portion of on-campus costs resulting in overpaid fees. I lived off-campus during this time and had NO KNOWLEDGE that I was being overpaid. I found out today that the money was a sum of $504 between myself and my friend and teammate over a telecom fee ($252 each). I don\u2019t even know what that fee is. $252 individually in exchange for most of my UMass college career being erased alongside my teammates. That\u2019s what I and my teammates have to pay for a mistake no one knew about and would later try to correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUMass itself cooperated by paying a self-imposed fine of $5,000 and will be under two years probation. Our athletics director Ryan Bamford announced that he stands by the tennis team and will appeal the decision because simply it was not our fault.&nbsp;\nIf you look at some of the most well-known sports commentators, such as Jay Bilas, they agree that this penalty is disproportionate and does not give any incentives for schools to come forward. In the history of the NCAA, there have been far bigger violations (done with intent) that have received less proportionate penalties.&nbsp;\nWe won the Championship fairly. No one knew about the money. There were no sports performance-enhancing violations resulting in any of our victories. The $252 made no difference. Just an unfortunate headline in what already is a tough year.&nbsp;\nCharacter is something that we talked about in our locker room every day. We understood that in most cases we would be the underdog and we would fight as hard as we could to win. But always with character and the professionalism that represents the UMass Flagship. We will do the same for this matter.&nbsp;\nWe feel that it is the NCAA's responsibility to protect student-athlete well-being. By penalizing the tennis team it sends the message that we did something wrong. Because of misleading headlines and this message, we now see our pictures being posted online with labels such as \"cheaters\" and \"dirty\". The NCAA CoI is placing blame on student-athletes that had no part in a mistake that was made by a university in which the NCAA manages. A mistake that was self-reported in an effort, to be honest, and protect their student-athletes. This NCAA is wrong here on so many levels.&nbsp;\nI ask of my friends, colleagues, opponents, to support this petition for the NCAA not to vacate at least our championship but also two years of competing during 2015-2017. I could not be more proud of the work and effort that went into this team. Many of you may not see the big deal because it does not affect you. But I can absolutely say that if you have ever poured everything you possibly could into something and were finally rewarded for that behavior, and had it taken away for something out of your control and by accident, then I think you can understand the devastation of the team, coaches, and athletic community.\nIt is a truly powerful thing to get the current and former athletes of the NCAA to sign this to bring to the CoI and the NCAA but we would love the support of everyone as sports goes far beyond the players and teams.&nbsp;\nPlease see the following links to further inform yourself on this matter and verify the facts mentioned.

As it is currently written, any future educator who does not hold a standard certificate by 12/31/2020 will be required to take a pass this new exam in order to gain licensure to teach in the certification fields below.\n\u2022 Early Childhood: EC \u2013 Grade 3\n\u2022 Core Subjects:\u202fEarly Childhood\u2013Grade 6\n\u2022 Core Subjects:\u202fGrades 4\u20138\n\u2022 English Language Arts: Grades 4\u20138\n\u2022 English Language Arts and Reading/Social Studies: Grades 4\u20138\nThis new testing requirement goes into effect on 1/1/2021. With all the chaos that the year 2020 has brought us, the timing of this new requirement is less than ideal and highly offensive to intern certified teachers in the state of Texas for several reasons:\n1. Intern certified teachers have been working around the clock this school year. Being a first-year teacher in a normal year is challenging enough but during a pandemic when many are expected to teach in-person and online is crippling. There is simply not enough time in our overloaded schedules for an additional and unexpected exam requirement.\n2. In addition to the stress of managing online and face-to-face classrooms simultaneously, many intern year educators are burdened with the anxiety of maintaining their students' health, their families' health, and their own health during this pandemic.\n3. Intern certified educators are blessed to have maintained employment through the pandemic and closures from COVID-19 however, each family has its own struggles and many may have spouses that are unable to work or they or their family may have medical issues that limit their ability to work at this time. The new Science of Teaching Reading exam adds a financial burden on intern teachers and their families. This new exam costs $136. If a teacher does not pass, they are required to take it again and again paying full price each time.\n4. Many school districts across the state ask that all certification exams for intern teachers be passed by March in order to renew contracts for the following year. They want to know that these educators will have their standard certification by next fall. With the new testing requirements, many teachers will not be able to show proof of standard certification by March. This will put their employment with their district in jeopardy.\n5. All of the content area tests listed above have tested the same material that will be on the Science of Teaching Reading Exam. To intern teachers and anyone who has already shown mastery on their content exam, the Science of Teaching Reading Exam is redundant and unnecessary.\n6. The state is still unsure of how to exactly grade the Science of Teaching reading exam. For the first three months of 2021, the test will not be scored but rather listed as pass or fail. First-year teachers and those who have shown mastery of the content should not have to waste their time taking a required exam with no scoring rubric.\n7. Testing centers and spots are limited already due to social distancing practices. With many first-year teachers also still needing to take the PPR and ESL exams this will lead to more time taken away from students and school as well as some travel to get to a testing site with available spots.\nFirst-year teachers and future Texas educators who have passed their content exams are tired, nearing burnout, and are frustrated with this new requirement. Teachers teach because they love their students and want to help them grow. 2020 is challenging but we can help our students to the best of our ability. In order to give all the energy we possibly can to our students (who need us now more than ever), we are asking that if someone has 1) Earned their intern certification and/or 2) Began teaching at any point this fall they should be grandfathered in and not required to pass the STR exam in order to earn their standard certification. This will help first-year teachers to truly take care of their students' education in the way each child deserves.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/nr/fq/FxNrfQBMnXeKhKA-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609085649"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/dead-heads-jerry-garcia-palm-sunday-we-demand-a-time-release-screen-print-by-the-great-aj-masthay?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "JERRY GARCIA.

FLES has been significantly reduced over the years and is far from the original program design. In 2018 it was completely taken out of the first grade and the rollout to 4th and 5th grade was reduced from the planned 90 minutes per week to 60 minutes a week. Last year the Spanish instruction across all grades (2nd through 5th) was reduced from 60 minutes a week to 40 minutes a week. We, the parents, students, and community members find this change disheartening and strongly support that the program is reinstated to 60 minutes per week for the following reasons:\nUnlike other content subjects, language acquisition takes place through sustained and repeated interactions that recreate an immersive environment. Research shows that three times a week is the advisable time for students to get the benefits of \u201clanguage immersion\u201d without affecting core academic subjects. (ACTFL; Lewis, 2012). For example, the Miami-Dade County district guidelines recommend 90 minutes of foreign language instruction in elementary school as ideal\u2014even more than what we had before.&nbsp;\nEarly language learning improves cognitive abilities in children. Research indicates that learning a foreign or second language improves executive functions, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, parallel thinking, to name just a few. In fact, multiple studies have shown that students receiving foreign language instruction scored higher on standardized tests, including reading and math. (Clarke, 2013; Armstrong &amp; Rogers, 1997)&nbsp;&nbsp;\nLearning a foreign language and culture contributes to developing empathy and positive attitudes not only towards members of the target language but also towards other cultural groups in general. (ACTFL; M.J. and J.M Bennett, 2003; Bamford &amp; Mizokawa, 1989) In addition, the curriculum designed by our Spanish teachers at the Sharon elementary schools fosters intercultural communication by the exploration of different perspectives and interaction with others in and from another culture. Reducing the Spanish program would indicate that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not important to our community.&nbsp;\nEarly exposure to foreign language instruction results in students\u2019 higher level of confidence in their oral, written, and literacy skills. (Domingo &amp; Pessoa, 2005; Burton &amp; Swain, 2014) Dr. Magnan, the SPS FL coordinator, supports this notion: \u201cThis year we have been revamping the 6th-grade Spanish curriculum to adapt to the skills of our first FLES cohort of 6th graders. Our 6th-grade language teachers expressed, \u201cOur current sixth graders demonstrate a remarkably high comfort level with target language input. They have transitioned very smoothly to 80 minute (!) classes in the target language without the typical period of culture shock: \"My teacher speaks in Spanish the whole time!\"&nbsp; The FLES graduates are equipped with the strategies and experience needed to listen, read, and look for cognates, past and previous vocabulary, tone of voice, illustrations, etc. that allow them to make personal meaning of the {i + 1} target language input they are receiving. These students also have a markedly lower affective filter, and spend less time concerned about making mistakes in Spanish. This, in turn, leaves our FLES graduates free to channel more energy towards internalizing the language, rather than worrying about making errors. Overall, the comfort level with the Spanish language and the preparedness for learning, starting straight from day one, is a direct benefit of the FLES program in our elementary schools.\u201d&nbsp;\nChildren with special needs can benefit from gaining better understanding about their own language. (Leons, Herbert, &amp; Gobbo, 2009) Supported by research, our wonderful teachers, create a supportive in-class environment for all students by applying multimodal and multisensory methods that&nbsp;address all learning styles.&nbsp;Here is a wonderful FLES video that highlights the overall program philosophy and shows some of these teaching methods applied as well as how much the children enjoy this program. Moreover, earlier exposure would better equip this student population to participate at middle and higher school levels where foreign language is a state mandate.&nbsp;\nMinimal cost to the overall budget.&nbsp;The addition of 20 minutes per week for all students would require 1 full-time employee or less which is approximately $62,000 of the annual budget. (Per the Town's Annual Report, in 2019 the FLES salaries were $247,000 and this year they are $185,000.) With an annual budget of about $45 millions, that is approximately 0.1% of the overall district budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nCurrent students report very positive experiences. Simply put students LOVE this program and their Spanish teachers!&nbsp;\nThe American Council of Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) offers additional literature about the benefits of foreign language instruction for a well-rounded education. &nbsp;\nThank you for supporting the FLES program in Sharon!&nbsp;\nGisela Arag\u00f3n-Velthaus, Cottage Elementary\nLinda Cveckova, Cottage Elementary\nManjula Riley, Heights Elementary\nYael Nillni, Heights Elementary\nMarigny Rivers, Heights Elementary\nMar\u00eda Emilia Bianco, East Elementary\nAnd all the undersigned Sharon residents", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/qp/dc/xsQPDcmUzheEiJc-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610813192"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/sjusd-allow-all-students-to-participate-cohorts-in-sjusd?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Allow all students to participate cohorts in SJUSD!", "description": "Hi we are Amber LaFranboise (ASB President, SJUSD Student Board Member) and Lizette Chavez (ASB Athletic Commissioner) at Abraham Lincoln High School.

Did they forget you during holidays, and forsake you in sickness and betray bonds set by years of loyal tenancy?\nNo.\nThis is a city of and for the working class, built on the justly prideful foundations of blue collar strength paired with some noble, empathetic white collar knowhow. A city where such people, who suffer(ed) together are/were bound together, in a place where home owners of a not so far off yesteryear saw true that their tenants work(ed) hard and need(ed)/deserve(d) to eat, as well as have enough money to save, to move on to own their own properties as well in time. We were united by a common goodness and fairness. Fall River, a true community blanket patched of many yarns, bearing different colors and creeds was/is knit tightly and singularly by hard labour endured, fastened by hands, soaked and stiffened by the ages.&nbsp;\nBut now, I tell you, this unity is dying.&nbsp;\nReal estate opportunists, by and large, who come from out of our city, don't give a damn about how hard you work or how little you see your partners/spouses, family, sons and daughters. They do not care how old or sick you are or if you are doing it all on your own with the world against you. They do not care how clean you keep your home or if you have a long standing of dignity, pride and a neighborly attitude. Most are as distant from you, by the capital and elsewhere, in thought and function, so much so that you might as well be worlds apart. Your plight and pleas of justice are alien to them, as if you speak another language entirely. They are mostly blind and deaf to your just need, for the sake of their greed.&nbsp;\nThey come into our city, to flip and occupy, tossing law abiding people out left and right. They take what's ours as we have worked for decades ceaselessly for a space we do not even own.&nbsp;\nWhat's worse is the fact that some of our own, in this community, have betrayed us. They buy homes here and charge the same as those who do not know us. They are inspired by this Hellish inflation of unethical rent and have forgotten where they come from.\nThis land is our piece of the world, and belongs to those within who understand our way, our economy and our culture.\nWe are not to be thrown from the place we belong, on the grounds of having too little, when the prices are soaring too high beyond our reach, untethered to an anchor of just and reasonable charge.\nWhere will the elderly go if they can no longer afford the city they have existed in for generations on meager pensions? An early grave, that's where, without the coin for a stone to be remembered.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWhere will the young adults, at last going it alone, go?\nToo long has the rental system been gaged to force people into cramming within uncomfortable heaps with a bunch of strangers, in houses ill insolated, maintained and secured. People have been reduced to eating cheap unhealthy diets, because that's all they can afford. The sad truth is, if this continues, many will never know what it's like to have true independence or a breath of freedom because they will always live in fear. The majority are being lashed to overworking themselves, fearing for their lives during a pandemic.\nMany people restrain themselves from making logical complaints when something in the home goes awry, such as plumbing, vermin, lack of heat, noise or terrible neighbors, for fear that their rent will increase having irritated the landlord and still, many times, the voicing of such important things are ignored altogether because of the foreign attitude and unattainable audience of the landlord who's number and residence is guarded in ranks of so called \"care takers\" and business associates.\nThe question was posed; How then do these people keep filling up their rental properties if the people can not afford them?\nAnswer: I have found, through experience and by direct word of property managers that such people increase the rents to where it either forces the resident to pay the massive sum by the skin of their teeth, apply for rental assistance via section 8 (which they would have even more reason to charge outrageous sums) or flush out the residents financially and replaced them with residents of their other properties (which pay double or triple comparatively to this town). The residents we are replaced with are mostly trades people who work for the house flippers directly. So, in essence, our people are to be cut out and replaced by equally desperate persons already paying a massive rent to their bosses elsewhere and are entirely relieved to pay what our local economy would consider an absolutely insane expense. Their exodus from great metropolitan areas will not be noticed as the numbers of this town compared to theirs are staggeringly different.&nbsp;\nHow is this just?\nWhere will the single person and single parent go when jobs are scarce and times are hard, when hardly any trade thinks to train you and demand years of experience all the same? In this precise time, now, more than ever, a time that need be spent with family, because there's no one to care for them but themselves/yourself, a time where we have not yet been graced with a living wage, we need to fight for our right to live.\nMore will be homeless because of greed, if we do not do something. People will be shoved out into the cold during a pandemic. You're annoyed by pan handlers now? Just wait until you see the lines if this type of robbery continues.\nYou may find yourself being shoved out, as our city turns to utter ruin, blazing in a mirage of metropolitan light and laugher, enjoyed only by those turning their noses up to the wallowing majority scraping by, at a peasants, peasants sum totaling little more than $21,000 a year. Divided up by 52 weeks, which makes a year, the average person is making $412.5 a week after tax, totaling to $10.31 an hr. for a full time job.&nbsp;\nThey expect that your rent reflect a quarter of your monthly income and yet they charge you nearly the whole of it for your rent for any decent living space. The average rent for a&nbsp;1-bedroom apartment&nbsp;apartment in&nbsp;Fall River, MA&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;$1,214.&nbsp;This is a 35% increase compared to the previous year, when in Massachusetts, as a whole, the average monthly mortgage payment is&nbsp;$1,333 (according to Lending Tree). Though, looking for yourself at homes here in the city most rental properties go for $1,500 a month (which includes the tax rolled in). Comparatively this is a laughable fraction more than what you pay for a one bedroom apartment as opposed to a whole house.\nHow is this just?!\nThe answer is simple. We must Rent Control Fall River and save the common people, that includes yourselves.\nIt's the fair shake we all deserve.\nNow is the time to have heart and remember if we don't do something the outcome will effect all people, regardless of political stance on the right, left and in between. This is about remembering where you come from and who we all are!\nRemember that this is a community effort. Those who sign must live in Fall River, MA.\nUnite and petition to Rent Control our city\nRemember your loved ones who struggle(d) and those who are to come\nRemember there are those unseen and unheard who suffer in silence\nRemember yourself&nbsp;\nWe make the change\n&nbsp;\nI thank you all.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/3/rk/xv/fyrKxVKnLEFbJkF-800x450-noPad.jpg?1605561379"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/rockstar-games-revert-daily-challenges-to-how-they-were-before-december-1st-in-red-dead-online?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Revert Daily Challenges To How They Were Before December 1st In Red Dead Online", "description": "Daily challenges were one of the best things added to Red Dead Online. Rockstar Games first added them in February of 2019 and then improved them in the May 2019 Update. The improved challenges allowed you to build a streak. Here below is what they previously were\nDay 1-7 0.20 Gold Per Challenge With A 0.60 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7\nDay 8-14 0.30 Gold Per Challenge With A 0.90 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7\nDay 15-21 0.40 Gold Per Challenge With A 1.20 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7\nDay 21+ 0.50 Gold Per Challenge With A&nbsp; 1.50 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7,Plus At 28 Days You would get a free treasure map. You could continue this streak as long as you did one challenge per day.&nbsp;\nAfter 28 Days you could keep the streak and if you logged in once a day and did one challenge you can keep it going for hundreds of days with 0.50 gold per challenge.&nbsp;\nAdditionally with the Frontiers Pursuits update Rockstar had added 3 new roles the bounty hunter, trader and collector. These roles added brand new daily challenges that were role specific. You had even more ways of earning 0.50 gold per challenge. These were further increased with moonshiners and naturalist. Unfortunately with the Bounty Hunter Expansion Rockstar Games made a post in which they were ending the streaks at 28 days. They would now automatically reset past 28 days. This devastated many players who had well over a 300 day streak. Some players logged in everyday just to keep that streak. With that streak now gone many of these same players will not return to play Red Dead Online anymore. These were hardcore fans and some were over Rank 700. However the situation gets even worse.\nEven though Rockstar Games had told us a few days before the update that Daily Challenges would now be resetting on 28 days we were not told ahead of time that all daily challenges would now be cut in half. The new challenges are as follows.&nbsp;\nDay 1-7 0.10 Gold Per Challenge With A 0.30 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7\nDay 8-14 0.15 Gold Per Challenge With A 0.45 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7\nDay 15-21 0.20 Gold Per Challenge With A 0.60 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7\nDay 21-28 0.25 Gold Per Challenge With A&nbsp; 0.75 Gold Bonus For Doing All 7,Plus At 28 Days You would get a free treasure map and a bonus $100. The streak would now reset after 28 days going back to 0.10 Gold Per Challenge.&nbsp;\nThe role challenges were still there however they were also cut in half paying the same amount per challenge as listed above. If Rockstar Games is hoping to sell more gold bars microtransactions but cutting daily challenges this is not the way to do it. This will backfire as long time fans and players of Red Dead online will simply stop playing. I have had numerous messages myself from friends telling me they will no longer play because of the daily challenge nerf. Rockstar is a business and I understand that they make free content hoping people buy gold bars however they can do this without ruining daily challenges. Simply add more content to the game. Maybe houses and new properties that people have requested. If you add more content to the game people will be willing to spend more gold bars but simply cutting them out of no where will destroy the game. This daily challenge nerf should have never happened. We have been making the same amount of gold with the daily challenges for over a year and a half. Now out of no where they are cut and the streaks are capped? Rockstar claims they listen to fan feedback. Well in my opinion this is one of the best ways to give them fan feedback. Rockstar if you read this petition prove that you listen to feedback, because the majority of the Red Dead Online community is not happy with this change. Please share this petition and post it on Rockstar's feedback page down below. Please try to help this petition reach 50,000 signatures.

I have several dogs that are constantly being scared from excessive personal fireworks displays/uses through out the year, and as I work nights most of the time I am not home to let my dogs inside to keep them from getting lose or hurt during these personal fireworks displays.\nMost of these displays/uses take place well outside of the dates set forth by Arizona\u2019s Fireworks Law \u2013 House Bill 2246, as well as the legality of the fireworks used in these displays.\n5. \u201cPERMISSIBLE CONSUMER FIREWORKS\u201d:\n(a) MEANS THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF CONSUMER FIREWORKS AS DEFINED BY THE AMERICAN PYROTECHNICS ASSOCIATION STANDARD 87-1, STANDARD FOR CONSTRUCTION AND APPROVAL FOR TRANSPORTATION OF FIREWORKS, NOVELTIES AND THEATRICAL PYROTECHNICS, DECEMBER 1, 2001 VERSION:\n(i) GROUND AND HAND-HELD SPARKLING DEVICES.(ii) CYLINDRICAL FOUNTAINS.(iii) CONE FOUNTAINS.(iv) ILLUMINATING TORCHES.(v) WHEELS.(vi) GROUND SPINNERS.(vii) FLITTER SPARKLERS.(viii) TOY SMOKE DEVICES.(ix) WIRE SPARKLERS OR DIPPED STICKS.(x) MULTIPLE TUBE FIREWORKS DEVICES AND PYROTECHNIC ARTICLES.\n(b) DOES NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT IS DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO RISE INTO THE AIR AND EXPLODE OR TO DETONATE IN THE AIR OR TO FLY ABOVE THE GROUND, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, FIREWORK ITEMS COMMONLY KNOWN AS BOTTLE ROCKETS, SKY ROCKETS, MISSILE-TYPE ROCKETS, HELICOPTERS, TORPEDOES, ROMAN CANDLES AND JUMPING JACKS.\nI believe that banning personal fireworks displays/use in major city limits would save a lot of other pet and animal owners a lot of stress, from having to worry about whether or not there pets will be safe if they're not home if someone in there neighborhood decides to have a personal fireworks display while they are not home, and will also save money, time and effort of local police and fire personnel that have to respond to all of the phone calls related to personal fireworks displays.\nI am also worried that one of those excessive personal fireworks displays will result in an out of control display and set my house or one of my trees on fire in my yard and have seen other trees in my neighborhood set on fire during some of these displays, cause the end users are either careless, intoxicated or inexperienced on how to handle the type of fireworks they are using or they just throw the fireworks out of the window of a car while driving down the streets in some neighborhoods.\nAnimal Welfare: Animals are terrified of fireworks. On the Fourth of July alone, more than 1,000 animals are turned in to the Maricopa shelters. This doesn't count those killed while running loose or injured while trying to escape. Animal abuse is a felony crime; fireworks pose animal abuse.\nClean Air:&nbsp;We can't burn wood fires because they contribute to air quality problems that may cause federal fines. Fireworks create air quality impact that are just as dangerous.\nRespect for Veterans: For those suffering PTSD, veterans and others, this is just disrespectful.\nNeighborhood Quality: Those with jobs, infants, and elderly need their sleep.

Concerned residents of Milton earnestly request your support for our preservation efforts to save The McGinley Mansion, located at 582 Blue Hill Avenue, from the proposed destruction of this historical gilded-era property and its award winning gardens designed by famed, trailblazing landscape architect, Ellen Biddle Shipman. The proposed development to replace this architectural time piece calls for a 118 unit building with 176 parking spaces.\nThe McGinley Mansion was designed in 1925 by Henry Ford Bigelow and Phillip Wadsworth of the Boston firm Bigelow &amp; Wadsworth, premier architects of their time. Both Bigelow and Wadsworth were residents of Milton and nearby neighbors to the McGinley family, making this mansion a particularly personal effort. Together, some of their work includes the Boston Athenaeum (designated as a National Historic Landmark) and George R. White\u2019s magnificent Lilliothea in Manchester-by-the-Sea, where they partnered with the Olmsted brothers as landscape architects for this spectacular estate.&nbsp;\nBigelow and Wadsworth\u2019s partnership with Ellen Biddle Shipman as landscape architect for the McGinley Mansion marks a historic partnership as well, as Ms. Shipman was one of the earliest female landscape architects of significance and a trailblazer for generations of landscape architects that followed. As a fierce advocate for women, Ms. Shipman was said to have hired only women as they embarked upon their careers after graduation from nearby Lowthorpe Department of Landscape Architecture (since acquired by Rhode Island School of Design). Ms. Shipman\u2019s work can be found up and down the east coast, and many of her gardens are located on sites included on the National Registry of Historic Estates. Described as being at the \u2018zenith of her career\u2019 when she designed the award-winning gardens of the McGinley estate, Ms. Shipman\u2019s work here is also significant for her collaboration with Edith Schryver as part of the design process. Ms. Schryver went on to form one of the first women-run West Coast landscape architecture firms. As one publication states, \u201cGiven its strong connection to these pioneering designers, the McGinley Garden\u2019s pedigree is particularly rich and significant for the history of landscape architecture.\u201d\nDespite vigorous opposition from numerous historical societies, including Historic New England, the Milton Historical Commission, Preservation Massachusetts, Society of Architectural Historians and the nationally-based Cultural Landscape Foundation, the developer (Comprehensive Land Holdings, LLC), is moving forward with their plans to raze this historical property to the ground, replacing it with a 118 unit apartment building which sits upon a parking structure for 176. The developers\u2019 plans not only destroy important historical elements of our town, but they also exploit the boundaries of responsible development and represent a drastic departure from the character of the neighborhood. As proposed, the development will rise almost 5 stories high (100\u2019), including a 30' retaining wall. There is limited green space and recreational use for occupants. The lack of sidewalks and any amenities that high density developments are expected to adhere to (schools, public transportation, shopping) result in car dependent development. This creates unnecessary safety and traffic concerns that result from a single egress development.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBy signing this petition you are demonstrating your support for the preservation of historical, landmark properties in our town, and appropriate, responsible development. We will submit this petition to the Zoning Board of Appeals to underscore residents\u2019 concerns over the destruction of this historical property and to urge our town officials to campaign for an alternative solution to this current proposal.&nbsp; We ask that the town explore all options available and advocate vigorously for our residents.&nbsp;\nThank you for your support!\nEmail us at vosehillassociation@gmail.com to join our mailing list and to keep updated with this project.

As long as there is no incentive to register, the city will not be getting the influx of cash that they should be getting from people registering their dogs.\nDog permits should be issued only to LB dog owners who must apply and provide documentation of their dogs having their shots and having been spayed/neutered.\nPeople can apply, and be issued a permit that their owner or dog walker must carry a copy of and show to Beach patrol if approached. Those who are caught with dogs on the beach without a dog permit should be fined.\nDogs over 6 months old that are not spayed/neutered should have a $50 fee to register with city while the fee remains $10 for puppies and spayed/neutered dogs. Proof of registration is not to be acceptable in lieu of a dog permit to the beach, because dogs older than 6 months that are not spayed/neutered are not to eligible for a dog permit to the beach.\n&nbsp;\n3) A rule stating that there should be no more than four dogs on any one beach will curb the the potential for too many dogs on our beaches.&nbsp; If there are already 4 dogs on one beach, a dog owner must walk down to the next beach over or leave and come back another time.\n&nbsp;\n4) People caught not properly disposing of their dogs to poop on the beach/boardwalk should be fined and their dog permit revoked.\nMost people walk their dogs prior to going on the beach so that they pee and poop before arriving there, so it shouldn\u2019t even be as much as an issue as people are afraid it would be.\nWhere there are \u201cno dogs\u201d signs, there can instead be signs that say \u201cCurb your dog or face a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment.\u201d That is the consequence in Atlantic Beach, and it should motivate people to never forget to carry a roll of poop bags with them here in LB as well.\n5) If a dog ventures near the jetties, the dunes, or seagulls, the owners will be subject to being fined and having their permit revoked. This will ensure that dogs on the beach will not pose a threat to the integrity of the landscape and the safety of wildlife.\n&nbsp;\n6) Rather than banning dogs from all beaches, certain beaches where dogs remain banned can be designated.\nNational, Edwards, Riverside, and LB Rd beaches can be banned to dogs, while all beaches East of LB Rd and West of National Blvd are dog-friendly.\nThis way people who don\u2019t like dogs have plenty of beach space to go to where they can expect it to always be dog-free, and there will be no potential for conflict between dog owners and any beach goers who dislike dogs.\n&nbsp;\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIf it costs an extra $10 to submit an application for a dog permit and every dog owner in LB registers so that they can apply for a dog permit to the beach, the parks and recreation department (or whatever department of the city\u2019s choosing) can be funded to do the work of sifting through applications and assigning a permit to dogs who have the necessary documentation making them eligible for a permit.\nA $10 fee to renew the permit every year would generate extra income for the city.\nAtlantic beach allows leashed dogs in the off season, and it remains clean, pristine, beautiful and safe. https://ecode360.com/7201844\nMontauk allows dogs on the beach all year long. May-September they are only permitted outside of the hours 10am-6pm.\nMany nature preserves and parks throughout LI allow dogs, and they remain unharmed while the experience of visitors is elevated by the sight of adorable, adventurous, friendly dogs. Any speculation that allowing dogs will result in problems is unfounded. Weak attempts at arguing the point that dogs will cause problems are based on speculation and pseudo-evidence clearly derived from confirmation bias.&nbsp;\nWe should not have to drive to another town in order to enjoy the beach with our dogs when we can walk to the beach in our own town from our homes.

The decision to oppose the electoral votes from six states without cause amounts to the blatant promotion of insurrection against the United States of America.&nbsp;\nOn December 11, 2020, New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell called[2] on the Speaker of the House and Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren of the Committee on House Administration, to take action to expel these 126 representatives.

[4]\nThese individuals must be held accountable, and so expelled from the House for engaging in seditious conspiracy and inciting insurrection in accordance with the Articles and Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nIt must be firmly remembered that at the time these individuals lent their signatures to this conspiracy, an attorney for Donald J. Trump had called for Christopher Krebs[5] former director of the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency to be shot; the capitol of Michigan was closed after credible threats of violence [6]; elections officials in Georgia confronted numerous threats of violence[7]; there were violent protests in DC [8] and in the State of Washington one person was shot at protests over the outcome of the election.[9]\nViolence and threats of violence from coast to coast.

His father was in the military and he had 2 brothers. He was arrested in 1986 for first degree murder.&nbsp;\nKevin was spending time with friends one night, he had been drinking and he fell asleep in the car while his friends committed a crime of horrible nature. He was not aware that this had occurred when his friends brought him home that night. Not long after, the police showed up and arrested him for having blood on his shoe. To this day, we do not know how there was blood on his shoe, but there was. It was enough to try him for the death penalty, but was lessoned to 2nd degree murder as he was found not guilty of capital murder.\nHe has been in prison ever since.&nbsp;\nWhile incarcerated he has received a degree as a paralegal, he has been part of a program that trains dogs so that they may be adopted out to their forever homes called 'Puppies for Parole'. He has helped many of his fellow prisoners including helping to get one of them paroled. He is extremely kind, caring and intelligent. He has done so much to better himself since being incarcerated and all that he wants, is to be able to come home. He has been to 5 parole hearings, all of which have been denied with no explanation as to why or what he could do to be granted parole.&nbsp;\nHe has been incarcerated for a total of 34 years as of now. At his next parole hearing, it will be 36 years total.&nbsp;\nThe parole board will not give any insight as to why he continues to get denied, or what he could possibly do to change their decision. I have been told that as long as the family of the victim continues to show up, he will not be released. While I can understand wanting to give the victims justice, how many years does a man need to give, how many lifetimes will it take to say that he is sorry for the loss of their loved one and that even though he was not the one who should have been punished for this loss, he has taken responsibility for it and given up over half of his life. If he had been the one to do such an unspeakable crime, I would not be here asking you for your help. A life sentence for a life sentence, is just in my opinion. But, this man does not deserve to lose another day of freedom for this crime. I promise you, he is not a cold-blooded murderer who deserves to be where he is at. He is not beyond redemption. Why bother giving parole hearings if there is nothing he can do to change the outcome of said hearing? We cannot change immutable facts, such as family showing up. So this just may be our last resort before the criminal 'justice' system takes another bright light that did not deserve it. THIS IS NOT JUSTICE!\nAll that we want, is for a good man, who has repented as well as paid for his crime, to be able to come home to his family - after so many years away. Please help us by signing this petition for the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole so that we may help our dear friend/family. We would never ask of such a thing if we did not know beyond a shadow of doubt, that he was a good man that deserves a chance to be a free man and make further amends for his crime.\nThank you.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/wc/gg/nzwcgGWJvGhfqXk-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609800269"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/stop-gentrification-now-demand-historic-smithfield-school-stays-in-our-community-s-hands?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "STOP GENTRIFICATION NOW!

Hill Elementary School into the Hill Mutual Aid and Education Center (Hill Center).&nbsp; The Hill Center will follow Community School principals and will partner with the surrounding schools (Parker, Wilkerson, and Tuggle), churches, and neighborhood associations to uplift the community. With programming that includes education, agriculture, housing, food, community development, art, and healing, the Hill Center will serve as a holistic community school and resource to all residents of Birmingham.&nbsp; The Hill Center\u2019s location in the historic Smithfield community and its proximity to public transportation mean these resources will be available to residents across the west and north ends of the City. These areas have been historically under-resourced, and the Hill Center will be a critical tool in addressing systemic inequalities and bringing asset-based community development to these neighborhoods at a critical time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe concept of the Hill Center grew and developed from the directly stated needs of the community members.&nbsp; Local community members do not want aging blighted properties transferred to parties without a plan for improvements, nor do they want development without community input. Instead, they want a community school and center that fosters healthy community interaction, healing, creativity, and community asset development.&nbsp; Above all, community members universally expressed that such a place should be owned by and be responsible to the local community and that it be located in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWith the World Games coming to Birmingham in 2022, it is more important now than ever to support community-led development. International sporting events often lead to the displacement of lower-income residents and exacerbate racial segregation. The creation of the Hill Center would allow residents to develop and thrive, and bring much needed asset-based community development to the West Side of Birmingham during a critical time.\nBirmingham Board of Education Contacts:\nDistrict 1 - Dr. Douglas Lee Ragland (Huffman Academy, Sun Valley, Smith Middle, Huffman High) Email: dragland@bhm.k12.al.us&nbsp;\nDistrict 2 - Terri Michal (Martha Gaskins, Robinson, Christian Academy, Huffman Middle, Ossie Ware Mitchell, Putnam) Email: tmichal@bhm.k12.al.us&nbsp;\nDistrict 3- Mary Boehm (Avondale Elementary, EPIC, Glen Iris, Ramsay High) Email: mboehm@bhm.k12.al.us&nbsp;\nDistrict 4- Daagye Hendricks (Hayes, Hudson, Inglenook, Woodlawn) Email: dhendricks@bhm.k12.al.us&nbsp;\nDistrict 5- Mickey Millsap (Barrett, Oliver, Phillips Academy, Parker) Email: mmillsapjr@bhm.k12.al.us&nbsp;\nDistrict 6- Cheri Gardner (Hemphill, Washington) Email: cgardner2@bhm.k12.al.us&nbsp;\nDistrict 7 - No current representative (Oxmoor Valley, West End Academy, Arrington, Jones Valley, Wenonah)\nDistrict 8 - Sonja Q.

Our concerns include the following material considerations:\n1. With 72 units in a 3-building complex of 2.5-stories each, this complex does not fit in with the design of the neighborhood and it will detract from the mostly one-story single-family homes in the area. &nbsp;\n2. Although Detour Road was recently paved, it remains a single-lane road with an even bigger shoulder drop-off than before, increasing the potential for accidents with increased traffic. A 72-unit complex will add potentially 144 adult drivers (or more) on a regular basis, which will unreasonably worsen traffic.\n3. Plans include parking for a limited number of residents at the complex and this doesn\u2019t even account for teen residents with vehicles or visitors to the complex. There is absolutely no parking available on the one-lane road and adding a 72-unit complex without sufficient parking will create a problem for other local residents.\n4. The lot contained numerous mature trees that have already been removed, but if the area is rezoned, the likelihood that the area on the other side of the tracks will also be developed into multi-family housing, which will lead to the removal of additional mature trees that would take decades to mitigate.\n5. Noise and light pollution in this area will be dramatically increased with a 72-unit apartment complex, which will have a negative environmental impact in this agricultural area. This includes a threat to the Gray bat, an endangered species in this region.\n6. The proposal to bring in this many more residents to an undeveloped area will place strain on county resources, especially emergency services. This is particularly true with the one-lane road that is frequently blocked by a train from various entry points.\n7. It is wrong to profit one individual when an entire community stands to suffer. This property could easily be sold in parcels within the current zoning regulations if the owner wishes to sell.\nThe Planning Commission Staff Report and the Hamilton County Engineering recommend against this rezoning. We realize that the County Commission could still approve it, but we are asking you to vote based on those recommendations as well as the desire of local residents. Development should enhance residents\u2019 lives, not line the pockets of one property owner or development firm. This apartment complex would unreasonably diminish the quality of life in this neighborhood.

The new guidelines state that remote delivery will ONLY be available to students who \"physically cannot be on campus due to a diagnosed medical condition that creates a greater risk for she/he contracting the virus.\" and \"Students traveling from a place with a travel ban or restriction.\" &nbsp;\nThe new policy adds that, \"Temporary remote delivery will continue to be available to students for the spring 2021 term for the following reason:&nbsp;Students who are in quarantine and/or isolation will be given temporary remote access to their classes.\"&nbsp;The deadline they released to request remote delivery was Friday, Jan. 8, 2021. The policy adds that, \"Our experience from the fall semester shows that our classrooms are safe environments.\"&nbsp;\nAs Gannon University Students, we believe that right now, at the peak of this terrible pandemic, Gannon students should not need to provide any formal excuse to utilize online learning options from their pod at their home.\nReasons for this conclusion include:&nbsp;\n\nThe current policy does not take into account students with other disabilities, beyond those that make them more susceptible to COVID, that threaten their sense of safety on campus. This includes students with mental health disorders, trauma histories, and other personal issues that may make living in isolation on campus, or attending classroom gatherings difficult.&nbsp;\nThe current policy operates under the assumption that this semester is the same as last semester, and that classrooms will remain a safe space despite the significant influx in cases of COVID across the country, and in Erie County, over break&nbsp;\nThe policy disregards commuter students and healthcare workers. The current policy does not account for any life circumstances beyond very specific physical illnesses. Commuter students who live with family members who are immunocompromised, and students who are healthcare workers are not considered for remote delivery.&nbsp;\nUltimately, the policy fails to acknowledge that if students- for any reason- do not feel comfortable gathering in class (a high risk situation according to CDC guidelines) or living in tight quarters with other students on campus, they should have access to remote classes through the infrastructure that already exists on campus (cameras and microphones have already been installed in classrooms).&nbsp;\nAt a time when in-person gatherings are risky, having less students on campus should be a welcomed, not resisted, as it will decrease risk for all members of our Gannon and Erie community.&nbsp;\n\nWhile we recognize that their is a financial strain being placed on all campuses, across the nation right now due to this unexpected pandemic, we stand together today to ask that Gannon places it's values of \"inclusiveness and social-responsibility\" above all else, and work with students to reimagine remote delivery guidelines to accommodate the circumstances and personal limits of all students.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/pr/ye/pLpRYeLddMrRbQF-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610554156"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/philadelphia-eagles-fire-howie-roseman-eb949679-d650-403a-aeea-b39f5826b9d5?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Fire Howie Roseman", "description": "Howie Roseman is directly responsible for the depressing state of Philadelphia Eagles football.

This corner has always been unsafe; over the decades, additional measures\u2014boulders, yellow curve signs, and guardrails\u2014have been added to the curve to keep cars from leaving the road. However, these measures are not sufficient.\nIn 2020 alone, members of the SDoT have responded to five instances of guard rails being destroyed on the corner. There was at least one other incident in which a car lost control and hit the rail but did not cause enough damage for the team to respond. Vehicles do not slow down around the corner either due to distraction, impairment, high-speed police chase, or simply wanting to \u201cdrift\u201d around the corner. People who live on the corner can attest to the offenders who drive the corner repeatedly to see how quickly they can go without losing control. On Christmas Day around noon, an impaired driver coming down 35th Avenue SW at a high rate of speed \u201cmissed\u201d the turn and collided with the guardrail. Five of the 6\u201d x 8\u201d posts (sunk 6\u2019 in the ground) snapped in half and sent the metal of the guardrail across the sidewalk and into the rocks. The driver simply drove away, leaving the damage behind. Two days before being destroyed on December 25th, the guardrail had been rebuilt from an accident that occurred overnight on December 3rd. This accident was caused by a high-speed police chase in which the driver came down 35th Avenue SW at breakneck speeds. The driver \u201cmissed\u201d the curve, hit the end of the guardrail and was launched 20 feet over the huge boulders marking the edge of the park. Only then did the car come to a crashing stop in a dirt berm just feet from the fence line delineating the park from private property. Another incident occurred in early spring in the middle of the day. A teen driving a rental car with a friend, lost control coming south on Marine View Drive and crashed into the guardrail in front of our driveway. This crash not only totaled the car but snapped two 6\u201dx 8\u201d posts and drove the metal rail feet into the driveway north of the accident. Multiple crashes have occurred in the middle of the night; miraculously the drivers are able to limp off in their semi-crashed cars leaving the neighborhood to pick up the glass, plastic, and car parts strewn at the scene of the accident.\nIn 2019, the guard rail was destroyed at least three times. Previous years have similar rates. This is not a one-off issue. The Seola Greenspace park is a very popular park for children, dog-walkers, pedestrians, and joggers. Neighborhood Easter egg hunts are held there, children play among the trees, dogs happily run off leash and countless neighbors visit the park to relax and find outdoor respite, particularly during COVID. Every day, dozens of neighbors walk or jog by as part of their routine. It is only a matter of time before an innocent pedestrian loses their life on this corner. We\u2019re urging you to have speed humps placed before and after the curve to prevent drivers from purposely or accidently speeding through the turn. I and fellow neighbors believe this would be the most effective course of action and not require an abundance of city resources and budget.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/0/zg/qx/nPzGQxpfcctanSI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610426006"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/we-the-people-impeach-the-democratic-party?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Impeach the Democratic party\n(Please share this with everyone you know)", "description": "Clearly the nation has spoken and no one is listening. &nbsp;The votes do matter, it is our governmental right and our voice. &nbsp;Those of you, true American Patriots, that have the moral courage and conviction to stand, to be heard and fight for our Constitutional rights to not be infringed upon will gladly stand with me and get something done. &nbsp;I don't even know if it's possible to impeach an entire party but United we stand and by the power we have through the Constitution, THEY WILL HEAR US.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/kc/wh/iuKCwhwPvdLrkKr-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610651370"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/sakae-esuno-mirai-nikki-future-diary-season-2?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Future Diary - Season 2", "description": "Hello, my name is Andrew. I know Future Diary finished ages ago, but I am looking forward to getting a second season. And I will tell you why. Nowadays, it is so hard to find good anime, and the new generation of kids, they didn't get to enjoy the experience of an anime. And yeah, for me Future Diary was a great anime. But when the first season ended, and I saw that there was no second season, I felt a void in my heart, and I think there are many others who felt the same way as me. The new generation, they did not enjoy and will not be able to enjoy the experience of an anime or great drawings, which made our childhood more beautiful, because they are forgotten. Exactly, forgotten forever. Not only by the creators but also by us. When a creator no longer sees support, he gives up continuing that project. That is what happened with Regular Show, Adventure Time and many others. They have been forgotten by many, and in a maximum of one year, they will be ignored by all. That is happening all over the world, not just in the virtual environment :( Also, you may be wondering why a petition for Future Diary (an old anime) and not a plea for any other newer, better anime? Because the old is gold. The ending was weird, I was left with many questions, and it lasted too little, and I know I'm not the only one. Also, OVA just showed us that Yuno found Yuki again, and she is ready to fulfil his desire to see the stars. I know that the creator can give life to season 2, by continuing this part. And you may believe or not; you can learn from an anime what the teachers can't teach you at school, nor the parents at home. How to love, how not to give up when you are thoroughly grounded, and it seems that you have nothing left to do, and more than that, it motivates us. So, let's bring back that old and childish atmosphere together! And you may believe or not, and you can learn from an anime what the teachers can't teach you at school. That is not just about Future Diary. I promise that if we have another season of Future Diary, I will continue to post petitions and recover the much-loved series. Because if we support each other, we can achieve whatever we set out to do. If I caught your eye, I'm just asking for one thing.

Air quality inside casinos was assessed by University of Nevada, Reno researchers in 2013 and found it is as bad as the outside air when there is poor air quality due to wildfires. If you want to read more about the limitations of air filtration on secondhand smoke, this website has info on the science.&nbsp;\nDecision makers have been fearful of economic loss if they don\u2019t allow smoking in bars and casinos, but after at least 175 gaming venues in the US reopened smoke free as part of COVID-19 guidelines, there are at least 964 U.S. casinos and gaming venues with 100% smoke-free policies. Gaming properties are finding that going smoke free is good for health AND good for business. More info about smoke-free casinos nationwide can be found at www.smokefreecasinos.org; a list of smoke-free gaming facilities can be found here: https://no-smoke.org/at-risk-places/casinos/.\nWe don\u2019t have to wait for state law to change \u2013 our cities and county can make regulations now that would make our workplaces smoke free.\n\nEmployees deserve smoke-free workplaces, and visitors deserve to go to these businesses without exposing themselves to smoke and vape.

The trail will also be part of MWRA\u2019s Aqueduct Trail system and will serve as a future connection to Framingham\u2019s Aqueduct Trail on the east side off Pine Hill Road. Constructing this trail will not only help to close the trail gap in Southborough but will also expand recreational and open space resources for the community and increase the walkability of Southborough via trails.\nThe Committee and the Town of Southborough have a good working relationship with DCR and are very appreciative of the opportunities our community has had for passive recreation on DCR property in our area. With your support, we look forward to expanding this opportunity to include this property as well.&nbsp;\nSTAND WITH US and ADD YOUR NAME to this statement of support to help us OPEN THIS TRAIL!\nPlease SHARE THIS STATEMENT OF SUPPORT&nbsp;to help us reach the masses.\nhttps://www.change.org/southboroughtrails\nTHANK YOU for your support.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/4/au/yc/AEAuyCYclDDxSuT-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608213069"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/secretary-of-state-for-arizona-count-every-legal-vote-in-arizona?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "COUNT EVERY LEGAL VOTE IN ARIZONA", "description": "This petition demands the Secretary of State for Arizona to immediately initiate a hand recount of all legal ballots cast in the State of Arizona.&nbsp;The American people, both Republican and Democrat, and particularly the people of Arizona, must be assured that their elections are fair and equitable.

On October 1, 2012, Shawn took part in the murder of Mr. Dean Compton and takes full responsibility for his role in the crime and the damage he inflicted not only on Mr. Compton's family and friends, but on the community as well. Shawn is conscious that because of his actions, lives are forever changed. He understands there will never be an excuse for what he did, and he describes his actions as truly heinous and cowardly and knows there were other ways he could have handled the situation. Shawn admits that he should have taken more of a stand to prevent Mr. Compton's murder.\nAs a child, Shawn would seek acceptance through his friendships with his peers. Desperately wanting to fit in, he would go along with the crowd instead of voicing objections to things he didn't agree with. He became a people pleaser and co-dependent in order to avoid rejection, shame, and loneliness. Though Shawn had no previous history of violence or any criminal activity, that need for acceptance and belonging contributed to his willingness to become involved in this crime.\nShawn knows that he hurt many people including Mr. Compton's family and loved ones along with his own family. The guilt and shame that Shawn feels in the murder of Mr. Compton is crushing and he is appalled with the memory of coming to a place in his personal life that led him to become involved in this crime. Although he realizes that he can never make direct amends to Mr. Compton, Shawn is making living amends daily to repair what is within his power and he is trying to be the very best man he can be every day. Shawn has done countless hours of groups and self-introspection to gain insight into and address the character defects that led him astray. A few classes that&nbsp;he has taken include anger management, criminal thinking, family relations, substance abuse, and victim impact. He has become a state certified drug and alcohol counselor in the desire to give back for all that he has taken. He has made it his mission to not only change his behavior, but also to help those in his community who are willing and ready. It is Shawn's belief that the primary goal of incarceration is rehabilitation and he wholeheartedly embraces this concept. Shawn fully understands that violence in any form is not the answer nor an option to problems and it only leads to pain and misery.\nToday, Shawn leads by example and understands that nothing he says or does will ever bring back Mr. Compton. Moreover, he would like nothing more than a second chance to repair the damage he has caused Mr. Compton, his family, friends, and loved ones. More importantly he sees the burden that his incarceration has had on the taxpayers and his family, and is pleading for clemency. Since the COVID-19 pandemic a solution that Governor Newsom has taken is to reduce the population of California's overcrowded prisons. Shawn is an excellent candidate.\nI thank you for taking the time to read this petition to free Shawn Bradley and ask that you please sign and share this petition in order to&nbsp;get him home to his family and give him the chance to make amends.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/2/ic/xy/lJicxYyyzheDDCC-800x450-noPad.jpg?1606594023"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/mayor-larry-klein-stop-the-city-from-removing-encampment-displacing-houseless-people?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Stop The City From removing Encampment and displacing houseless people", "description": "SUNNYVALE IS KICKING OUT HOUSELESS PEOPLE FROM THE PARK BY JANUARY 31st!!!&nbsp;\nDue to the construction going on at the park, they are closing off areas including where the encampment is.

Doing so places their teammates, coaches and other Beach teams in greater jeopardy of exposure. This policy is in place until further notice.\"\nSo, only Virginia Beach is under this prohibition. Where is the science behind this??\nThis policy needs to be changed immediately because:\n- Our Virginia Beach athletes are no different from those in neighboring communities and are not putting anyone at more risk than our neighbor athletes.\n- Virginia Beach is the ONLY city with this rule. Other athletes in other cities in the area do not have to choose between playing for their high school and playing for their club.\n- Many students work outside of the home, eat at restaurants, volunteer, and visit with friends and family, yet they are not under these same restrictions. Are those activities more safe than playing a club sport outside of high school?\n- A study from the University of Wisconsin of Medicine and Public Health reported that its state's high school sports have not caused an increase in COVID-19 infections among athletes.\nIt is time to stop making arbitrary rules not based on science that punish students only in Virginia Beach. Allow our Virginia Beach children to play for their high school AND still pursue their passions on their club teams because other districts have found it safe.

Supporters of this petition are asking Mr. Andre' Walker, HISD's current Athletics Director, to reverse his very recent decision to suspend all non-varsity athletics within HISD.&nbsp;\nOn January 11, 2021, Mr. Walker sent a memo communicating HISD's decision to cancel/suspend all athletics with the very narrow exception being high school athletics at the varsity-level. The memo states that this decision is being made due to \"a rise in Covid-19 cases in Harris County.\" However, given the fact that HISD tracks confirmed cases of Covid-19 on its own Covid-19 Dashboard, it is far more appropriate from a science-based standpoint for HISD to base its decision using its own more specific data. The data shows that the vast majority (60%) of the cumulative* student confirmed cases of Covid-19 are from elementary school children. HISD does not offer sports to elementary-aged children. Also, these students attend a separate campus. Therefore, elementary school data should not be considered in assessing whether junior high and high school athletics warrant cancellation/suspension. When combined, only 35% of the total cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the student population are from junior high and high school students. HISD should take a fresh look at the data with this in mind.&nbsp;\nAccording to the CDC, HISD outdoor athletics is already taking place with a reduced risk of COVID-19 transmission. It's important to note that HISD athletics in the Fall of 2020 did not have any major issues of community spread.\nParents are deeply concerned about the impact of suspending and/or cancelling all athletics. For many of these student-athletes, this would be the second time their sport has been cancelled. This puts them at a distinct disadvantage from a developmental standpoint. For many of these students, this developmental delay could impact their opportunities moving forward, including jeopardizing future scholarship offers. Also, studies show that participating in athletics and group activities is critical for positive mental health in students. Many parents have sited that they've seen increased depression and anxiety in their student-athletes due to these cancellations. According to this study&nbsp;from the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine, students participating in sports exhibit less anxiety, depression, and have an increased ability to concentrate. We all want that for our kids!\nUpon considering the aforementioned, we respectfully request that HISD reverse this decision to suspend all non-varsity athletics and allow our student-athletes to resume athletics immediately. We are also requesting a meeting to be held either online or in person to be provided with more information, including the science-based reasons for HISD's continued suspension of athletic activities.\nThank you for your support!

The current operator (Hountalas) and news reports confirm that The Cliff House will permanently close on December 31, for want of NPS renewing its concession contract (the Hountalas notice is posted in full below).&nbsp; Given that Hountalas has been the operator since 1973, and has developed credibility and respect in our community, we urge NPS to renew the concession or, through the Feinstein office, immediately discuss an equitable extension of the concession.\nKnown by all San Franciscans, and by many million visitors, The Cliff House is a valued institution and part of the fabric of the City.&nbsp; According to Hountalas and as confirmed by the San Francisco Chronicle, NPS failed to timely post, and then failed to timely respond, to the bureaucratic process of renewing the concession (a Request For Qualifications, or RFQ).&nbsp; Instead, NPS only granted Hountalas a series of short-term extensions.&nbsp; Now, NPS requires the RFQ process begin from the start, which will take years&nbsp; --&nbsp; and, in a startling new arrogant turn, without consulting those of us in San Francisco, NPS has stated that it is no longer looking to renew The Cliff House as a restaurant, despite its 157-year legacy.\nIn the meantime, ignoring the pandemic, NPS has refused to negotiate an extension with Hountalas, offering only another short-term \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d lease at full cost, regardless of the inability to operate a restaurant during this time.&nbsp; The result would be that Hountalas, unable to operate The Cliff House for these many months, must continue to pay all ongoing expenses regardless of the closure.&nbsp; Alternatively, Hountalas must remove the entirety of their many decades of historic property and all restaurant furnishings and equipment, by December 31.&nbsp; And then, The Cliff House will be a shuttered empty building for years.&nbsp;\nNPS, with its ever-rotating leadership in Washington, D.C., is acting like an unconcerned and heartless landlord, without heed for the many dozens of people who work at The Cliff House and the many thousands of neighbors in the community.&nbsp; This is shockingly inconsiderate behavior, as well as a failure to abide by its own government RFQ requirements.&nbsp; We are dismayed at the imperious manner in which this has been decided&nbsp; --&nbsp; and we are so disappointed, given the promises made by past NPC leadership when it took control of The Cliff House.\nWe urge Senator Feinstein to intervene with NPS.&nbsp; There must be a way to resolve this immediately and fairly, without high-handed \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d landlord tactics.&nbsp; The pandemic will pass, and NPS need not produce years of blight and the abject eviction of a good and important neighbor in our community.\nPlease sign this Petition to express your feelings about this important issue, and encourage corrective steps to be taken.\n&nbsp;\nFor more information on The Cliff House:&nbsp; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_House,_San_Francisco\n&nbsp;\nHOUNTALAS NOTICE OF EVENTS\nNPS Forces the Cliff House to Close Its Doors Permanently\n180 Employees Lose Their Jobs\nIt is with deep regret and heartbreak that we must inform you that The Cliff House will close permanently on December 31, 2020. Our 20-year concession contract expired on June 30, 2018; by that time, the National Park Service (NPS) should have selected an operator on a long-term basis to ensure the continued operation of this national treasure. Since then, the NPS has issued us one six-month and then two consecutive one-year concession contract extensions rather than proceed in a timely fashion with their responsibility to execute a new long-term contract or lease.\nThe first step in this process was to issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) which they did not do until August 13, 2019 \u2014 more than a year and half after this process should have begun. Since 2018 we have negotiated in good faith with the NPS to continue our long stewardship of this iconic San Francisco Landmark including our teaming with another operator which submitted a response to the requested RFQ. Our last extension was executed on January 1, 2020 and expires on December 31, 2020.\nAs we all know the unprecedented situation brought on by the Covid-19 Pandemic has decimated the restaurant industry. We have continued to uphold our responsibility throughout 2020 even though we have been unable to operate since March 17th. We did attempt to institute takeout service in early June but after 10 weeks could not continue to sustain the unbearable losses associated with takeout.\nIt costs tens of thousands of dollars every month to maintain and guard the massive Cliff House building. There really is no excuse to be in this situation. There was no COVID-19 in 2018; one or more upper echelon leaders within the NPS obviously did not do their jobs, resulting in this sad situation.\nThe NPS offered us a fourth one-year extension to continue guarding and maintaining their building with all costs to be paid for by us without any compensation whatsoever from the NPS. Unlike the government which is not held accountable for profits and losses we could not accept the additional extension as there is no possibility of doing a sustainable level of business for the foreseeable future.\nWe attempted to work with them to find a way to move forward given the challenges everyone continues to face during the pandemic. We waited patiently for a response from the NPS to our inquiries regarding the fate of The Cliff House. We finally received an answer at the late date of December 7, 2020. The decision they provided is as follows:\n\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first RFQ has expired and will need to be completely redone causing a further delay of what could be years. Given how that went in more normal times we do not expect this to be done in a timely manner.\n\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will not be an interim successor/partner so the building will be left unoccupied and watched over by the NPS at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\n\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must remove all personal property in the building including all memorabilia as opposed to being paid for our property by the ultimate successor operator as provided in our contract.\n\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be no effort to speed up the process for successorship.\nWe have been the proprietors of the Cliff House for 47-1/2 years and are probably the longest tenured in the 157- year history. We were in fact operating the Cliff House four years before it became part of the National Park System. We leased the Cliff House from George Whitney, Jr. in 1973 and the NPS did not purchase it until 1977.\nThis is certainly not the way to thank us, a local small business owned and operated by native San Franciscans, for taking care of this San Francisco treasure this past year at a significant financial loss. Again, this all could have been prevented by the award of a long-term contract two and half years ago.\nIt is obvious that the NPS has failed in its stated mission to safeguard natural and cultural resources:\nThe mission of the National Park Service is to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations. (Source nps.gov)\nAs a result, The Cliff House will be boarded up and fenced in for several years as they once again try to implement their own processes.\nRealistically we are looking at two to three years of a closed facility. And if there is insufficient maintenance done to keep it up, re-opening costs will be tremendous. How will The Cliff House look/feel when it eventually re-opens? Will there be some element of local ownership? Will it even be \u201cThe Cliff House?\u201d\nAll of us here at The Cliff House are outraged at the failure of the NPS to select a new long-term operator in 2018, thereby avoiding all this unnecessary hardship and heartache. In the meantime, a lot of priceless memorabilia will be auctioned off and be gone with the wind. Lost forever and with it an important part of San Francisco history.\nWe are seeking help in holding the NPS publicly responsible for their failures resulting in the loss of the livelihood of 180 employees and their families, as well as the loss of one of San Francisco\u2019s treasured landmarks and the financial loss suffered by those of us local folks who did our best to stay true to this legacy.\nTo show your support you can email the NPS directly at:\nLaura Joss &nbsp;--&nbsp; goga_superintendent@nps.gov\n&nbsp;\nThank You,\nDan and Mary Hountalas\nProprietors since 1973", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/ry/ih/duryiHnQliZPmwc-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608184117"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/usd-230-board-of-education-usd-230-spring-hill-school-district-gating-criteria?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "USD 230 - Spring Hill School District Gating Criteria", "description": "1/15/2021 Update:\nThe Board of Education (BOE) has decided to take the gating criteria to a vote on the 1/25/2021 BOE meeting.&nbsp; At that time they will decide to either keep it, or do away with it.\nIf they do away with it, they stated they do not know what they will do with Online Remote Learning (ORL).&nbsp; They may keep it or they may force all those kids to be in person as well.&nbsp; They may also keep it and give parents the choice of switching to ORL.\nWe can't take this risk.&nbsp; We need to stay the course.&nbsp; The gating criteria putting secondary in remote is not an indication that it has failed, but instead that it is working in the way it was designed to!\nSign.&nbsp; Share.&nbsp; Advocate for our kids!\n&nbsp;\nExplanation from November:\nThe USD 230 Board of Education (BOE) has stated they will be looking at changing the gating criteria at their next meeting, Monday, December 7. &nbsp;This will be the third time in one semester that our teachers, parents, and students have seen a change in what decides the learning mode.&nbsp;\nAs many of you know, the BOE first adopted the JCHDE gating criteria.

But the people of New Mexico have lost their voice and are no longer being served. Our governor has shut out the legislature. She has co-opted our state courts. She has done this by indefinitely extending her own emergency powers, granting herself and the health department far more power than they were ever intended to have. We are asking you, the legislators, to take back the power that was given to you when you were elected and represent the voices of the people of New Mexico.\nOur governor has decided that the only problem facing our state is COVID and the only solution to this problem is some degree of permanent lockdown. She claims she follows the science, even though none of her arbitrary policies have ever been shown to actually reduce the spread of a virus. Some of her policies, such as 14-day quarantines even with a negative test and the requirement to wear a mask while exercising go directly against CDC guidelines. She went so far recently as to restrict access to food, which created long breadlines in our state. This disastrous policy disproportionately harmed the poor and elderly \u2013 the very populations we most want to protect. In fact, more and more studies are showing that lockdowns and universal mask orders actually have the opposite effect of what is intended.\nShe is unable to consider or even acknowledge the myriad of secondary detrimental effects the lockdowns have caused in New Mexico including:\n\nIncreased numbers of suicides in NM, which was already ranked worst in the nation, including children\nIncreased domestic violence and child abuse\nIncreased depression, isolation, substance abuse\nPermanent loss of livelihoods for those people who have been deemed \u201cunessential\"\nPermanent loss of jobs\nShuttering of restaurants despite lack of any evidence that they are actually a problem\nHighest unemployment in the nation\nLoss of education\nTaking of income, businesses, property without compensation\nIndefinite shuttering of schools despite dozens of studies all across the world showing in-person learning doesn\u2019t significantly increase spread of COVID\nDisappearance of 12,000 New Mexican children from the school system\nDiscrimination against those with legitimate health concerns which prevent them from wearing masks or taking the vaccine.\nViolation of multiple basic, human rights including the right to earn a livelihood to feed our families, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom to petition the government.\n\nThe governor has signaled multiple times that she doesn\u2019t intend to ever let New Mexicans have their lives back. She has stated she views her current policies as being good \u201cforever irrespective of COVID.\u201d Her color-coded system for allowing counties to reopen shows that even with zero new cases for many rural counties, they will only be allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity. And there is no designated path at all for allowing bars, theaters, or other \u201cclose contact\u201d venues to reopen. Ever.\nThe undersigned request each and every one of our New Mexico legislators to vote for the bipartisan bill which will require buy-in from the legislature before the governor may extend emergency orders. After almost a full year of lockdown, there is now plenty of data, studies, and common sense ideas for allowing our communities to safely reopen while protecting the vulnerable. We have had enough of our myopic governor. We are asking you to hear our voices and represent us.", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/8/br/ht/USbrHtrvIYmgVjS-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609711751"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/instagram-instagram-needs-to-shut-racist-accounts-down?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Instagram needs to shut racist accounts down", "description": "For quite sometime Instagram has failed to remove Instagram accounts that were clearly racist and pages that has been clearly harassing and bullying some Instagram members with racial slurs.

Something that I have never even imagined I would experience. Something that I never even considered before in my short 18 years in this world. My 92-year-old grandfather, an amazing patriarch who has accomplished so much in his life and is an inspiration to countless people, is choosing to die. At least he wants to choose to die. Turns out this is much more complicated than one would think. As I spoke with my parents, I learned some very harsh realities about this issue in our country, and in particular in states like Illinois, where we live.\nYou see, my grandfather suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, and prostate cancer that has spread into his bones, among many other serious chronic health issues. Over the past several years, he has used countless medications to combat these health issues, including chemotherapy and a pacemaker. As these diseases continued to wreak havoc on his body, his quality of life continued to deteriorate.\nAt this point in his life, my grandfather is essentially a prisoner in his own home, in his own failing body. Miraculously, he is still completely mentally competent, and he continues to live alone in a condo within a wonderful retirement community. However, he can no longer go anywhere, as simply just walking from one room to another pains and tires him so completely that he can barely function. Even just moving from a sitting to a standing position is almost too much for him to take as he gasps for breath and fights through pain to continue moving. No matter what he does to try to fight these health problems, there is no longer any chance of recovery or improvement. The medical treatments being provided at this point are simply to prolong life and make him as comfortable as possible (which unfortunately is not even remotely comfortable by any stretch of the imagination).\nJust before Christmas this year, my grandfather made the announcement to his children (my father and his siblings) that he no longer wanted to live. He expressed how unhappy he is in this current physical state and sees no reason to go on. He knows that he had a very long, fulfilling life prior to this point. He had a successful marriage of over 56 years prior to my grandmother\u2019s death in 2014, and he raised five amazing children who all have families and successful lives of their own. He assured everyone that he is ready to move on to whatever lies beyond this Earthly life. And I believe him.\nBut there is even more to this story. His wife, my grandmother, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) when she was just 19 years old, before they were married and had children. In fact, she was told she should not even have any children due to her medical issues in relation to MS. Despite her prognosis, she went on to have five children while fighting her disease every step of the way. While the disease did progress throughout her life, it did not really slow her down until she was much older. Around 2010, when she was over 70 years old, it started to become too much for her. Eventually, she became bedridden. She lost her mental capacity and would often be completely unaware of her surroundings. Eventually, she lost the ability to eat. She lost the ability to communicate. She needed around the clock care, most of which was provided to her from my grandfather. He lived with her through every second of this extremely slow and painful approach to death. And because they live in Illinois, nothing could be done but wait. And wait. And wait. She became a shell of a person, her skeletal body shrinking more every day until eventually her body and mind gave out and passed on. For my grandfather and the rest of my family, this slow, painful death was completely heart-wrenching to experience. I sincerely would not wish it on my worst enemies.\nNow, as my grandfather looks towards that same fate, he is scared, as are the rest of us, his family. Scared to watch the same torture unfold for him as it did for my grandmother. To assist in his path towards death, my grandfather has elected not to have his pacemaker batteries replaced (which are expected to run out within the next few months), and he is no longer going to receive chemotherapy or any other life-prolonging medications or treatments. While this may help speed his life-ending journey along, it will certainly take some time to get there, which will likely be torture for him in his current physical state. It truly amazes me that in today\u2019s world, where we even grant our terminally ill pets the ability to die without extended pain and suffering, that we don\u2019t offer the same option to people. If only something more could be done for someone like him, to ease the pain, to honor his wishes, to allow him to move on from this life.\nTurns out something more can be done. At least in some states. Back in the 1990\u2019s, Oregon became the first state to enact a \u201cDeath With Dignity\u201d law \u2013 that is, to provide physician-assisted dying for those that suffer from terminal illnesses and diseases. This type of law allows those who have a confirmed diagnosis of a terminal illness, with a prognosis of less than 6 months to live, an option to end their life on their terms. This occurs through the use of a prescription medication that will hasten their death. Now, there are eight states (Oregon, California, Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey, Maine, Vermont), along with Washington D.C., that have similar laws that allow people the right to die. There are very strict protocols in place within these states to ensure that those who choose this path are not making their decision lightly.\nIt is my opinion, and the opinion of countless others with similar family experiences such as mine, that this type of law should also be passed in the state of Illinois, or even better, at the federal level. To that end, I have created this petition to show support for this issue. By signing this petition, you are expressing your support for terminally ill people to make their own end-of-life decisions. This option will grant them the dignity, control, and peace of mind that they deserve during their final days in this world.&nbsp;Thank you for reading my story, and thank you for your support!", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/7/lf/mv/FaLfMVrKdUIIuzk-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610576741"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/minnesota-wild-demand-that-fox-sports-north-renew-broadcasting-contracts-with-hulu-live-and-youtube-tv?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Demand that Fox Sports North Renew Broadcasting Contracts with Hulu Live and YouTube TV", "description": "We call on the owners of the MN Twins, MN Timberwolves, MN Wild, and the MN United FC along with the University of Minnesota, the University of North Dakota, the University of Minnesota Duluth, and the University of St. Cloud State to demand that Fox Sport North renew broadcasting contracts with Hulu and YouTube TV.\nYou fans should not be used as bargaining chips by Fox Sports North during a worldwide pandemic!&nbsp; At a time when fans are not allowed to attend games and so many people are struggle with their mental health, it is absolutely unconscionable for Fox Sports North to make us suffer so that they can profit.&nbsp;\nMany of us have already switched providers one or more times just so that we could continue watching your games, but enough is enough!&nbsp; The current solution provided by Fox Sports North is for us to switch providers once again to AT&amp;T, which is significantly more expensive for the plan that provides Fox Sports North and gets even more expensive after the 1st year!\nYou have the power to demand that Fox Sports north act more responsibly with your product and broadcast it out to your fans!&nbsp; You have the power to remind Fox Sports North that at some point their contract with you will have to be renewed and you will not forget how they treated your fans! &nbsp;You have the power to help your fans, so please do everything you can!&nbsp; With so much negativity in the world right now, your fans deserve better than what Fox Sports North is doing to us!", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/zz/dx/uDzZdxbfbcPSqDE-128x128-noPad.jpg?1585533775"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/food-and-drug-administration-change-the-legal-age-to-buy-tobacco-products-from-21-back-to-18?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Change the legal age to buy tobacco products from 21 back to 18", "description": "The law was introduced on December 20, 2019 which which included multiple bans in the tobacco/vaping industry and also included raising the legal age to buy tobacco/vaping products.\nThis law has made many Americans angry for those who where of legal age originally and now are not of legal age.

This ends any legal options that can be addressed through state law. &nbsp;In the meantime, the Board of County Commissioners has a brand-new inexcusable lie for killing Lladk: \u201clegal difficulties.\u201d They created the legal difficulties.

I proceeded by driving towards the front of the building when I spotted a Medium Pittbull mix Chained in the front of the building. I proceeded by checking for food and water and there appeared to be none, during my inspection I found marks on her neck. I couldn\u2019t find it in my heart to leave her so I took her. The next day i returned and the owner of the property Johnny Demel came out to confront me on why was on his property, I offered to help but the man refused help or to surrender any animals or let anyone inside the property. All that he wanted was money. I wasn\u2019t going to stop until I got answers. The man claims he picks up strays and slowly tries to find them homes with the help of 2 other people. The problem is the living conditions these dogs are in are worse than being out on the street. These dogs are kept chained up outside in the heat day and night. Some have been confirmed to be HW+ stated by the people who claim to be helping.

On September 29th 2020, when the president of the United States was asked to disavow white supremacist supporters and their violence in American cities during a presidential debate, Trump said \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d. Numerous reports have stated this was taken as a call to arms for white supremacist groups. On October 30th, we watched in horror as pro Trump supporters surrounded two Biden campaign buses on I-35 to force the Biden campaign to cancel it\u2019s political rallies in Texas. If the clear acts of political physical intimidation never seen before in American history were not enough, the President of the United States retweeted a video of this act with the caption; \u201cI love Texas\u201d. Before the general election on November 3rd 2020, the president continued to spread baseless claims that the election would be stolen and urged his supporters to physically watch the polling booths. His supporters, nationwide, showed up at polling places armed with weapons and were intimidating voters. Once the election results were verified, Trump continued to spread baseless claims that the election was stolen. On January 3rd 2020, it was revealed that Trump called Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to give him votes to win Georgia ; All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\u201d On January 6th 2020, there was a nationwide coup attempt which had been publicly planned for weeks prior. The United States Capitol building was stormed by pro trump supporters who were allowed into the Capitol building by members of Capitol police. Congresspeople and their staff were forced to shelter in place in their office as the Capitol building was invaded by Trump supporters who came equipped with zip ties to hold elected officials hostage and \u201cmurder the media\u201d written on the doors of the Capitol building. DC Council tweeted that their initial request (around 3:38pm) for the National Guard to be deployed was denied by the Department of Defense and when the National Guard was approved to be deployed neither Trump nor the Department of Defense were cited in the approval decision. Officer Brian D. Sicknick was killed due to his injuries defending the Capitol building from protestors. 2 pipe bombs and a cooler of molotov cocktails were found near the Capitol building amidst the riot. In California, Washington (state), Oregon, Utah, Michigan, Georgia, Colorado, Minnesota and Arizona, pro trump supporters on January 6th 2020 surrounded state capitol buildings and in some cases caused state governors to flee their residences. Just because the acts were not on par to the events at the nation\u2019s capital do not in any way lessen the reality of a coordinated nationwide coup d\u2019etat. The President\u2019s cabinet members are resigning in order to avoid the possibility of invoking the 25th amendment. For the American people, to rely solely on the hope of an impeachment trial to remove this possibility of another attempted coup d\u2019etat in coming days is far too naive. We watched idly by as this administration and his supporters (citizens, military and Congresspeople) have so boldly stoked increasing amounts of fear into the American people. At the time of this writing, there are several reports that more attempts will be made in the final (legal) days of this administration; January 19th and 20th. We cannot wait and sit in apathy any longer. We cannot outsource hope that the same federal agencies that allowed for this to happen because of their loyalty to Trump will step in and fulfill their sworn oath to the American people. These Trump supporters were let into the Capitol building by Capitol police. The Department of Defense denied requests for the National Guard to protect elected officials. The collusion of members of the federal government with the administration\u2019s attempt at a coup d\u2019etat cannot be understated. We must clearly state our demands for these acts of domestic terror, treason and sedition be treated as such. Coups are not stopped by the intelligentsia or a select few but the governed population as a whole not giving their consent to be governed by a hateful regime. Do not let your fear in these times paralyze you, you must stand for each and every American citizen by fulfilling your civic duty to each other. Circulate this petition and demand your elected officials seek not their own politically diluted brand of justice but the legally defined acts of domestic terrorism, treason, and sedition that were commited on January 6th 2020. We must hold all conspirators and including the sitting President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, to justice.\nWhat are the charges?\nUS Code Title 18 Chapter 115 Section 2381 \u2018treason\u2019: Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000;

The carcinogenic chemicals in styrofoam are released into food and drinks, and overtime can build up in the human body causing health issues that are irreversible.\nStyrofoam occupys 25-30% of landfill space across the world.

Unfortunately, burning styrofoam has extreme repercussions on the environment, as well as people. The black smoke produced by the burnt styrofoam is carbon monoxide.

What used to be a fully loaded top to bottom run featuring creativity, flow, and various features for all levels of riders is now an enormously wasted space on the mountain. When you look at the natural grade of Brooks (where the terrain park used to be) it couldn't be setup any better. There are natural rollers, width to include all of the features the Top Phlight crew has built over the years and most importantly; length. The length allowed the park to be spread out so that a flow could be established and speed could be carried at whatever level a rider desired. If you wanted a set of 8 increasingly large jumps in a row, it was there. Feel like riding off to the side and hitting a few rails on the way? No problem. It was perfect, everything a new or seasoned park rider could desire.Two seasons ago, a high speed quad chairlift was put in to replace the aging two seater that Brooks utilized for so many years. This was great move, efficiency is key. After installing that lift the decision was made to move the terrain park to Hogsback, and this is where things went wrong. Hogsback is way too short, steep, and narrow to accommodate a well built terrain park.&nbsp;The thought process behind moving the park was to increase overall mountain efficiency and provide another beginner area, but the opposite has happened. On any given day Brooks is likely the least utilized lift, especially in terms of people to mountain area usage. Hogsback is almost always the busiest which makes it impossible for people to get any sort of consecutive riding in at the park. What does this do? Makes the current terrain park vastly underutilized which now means two sections of the mountain are less efficient than before.&nbsp;The other side of things that I believe Stevens Pass is not considering is media presence. For a long time sponsored and pro riders/skiers would come to Stevens Pass to film and subsequently put out content. That no longer exists with the existing terrain park which means Stevens Pass is no longer being freely marketed to an enormous target market audience. Many of these riders would also come in the early/late spring when other day pass purchasers are done for the season, this means more revenue.&nbsp;Moving the terrain park back to Brooks would create vastly better mountain efficiency and restore one of the greatest aspects the mountain had to offer! The only hope for this campaign is for Stevens Pass Management to consider the request to move the terrain park back to Brooks, and hopefully create an open dialogue about what guests would like to see out of their home mountain.&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/6/gd/pe/BZGdpeZSkeOjxLS-128x128-noPad.jpg?1610498159"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/everyone-bring-dedrick-williams-home?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "Help Dedrick Get A Bond", "description": "Dedrick Has Been Wrongfully Accused In Participating In The Events That Lead Up To A Young South Florida Rapper By The Name Of XXXTentacion ; Losing His Life .

Fueled by the possibilities of rapprochement with the United States and the emotional distance wrought by time, children and grandchildren of exiles began traveling across the Florida Straits in increasing numbers.\nSince our founding, CubaOne has worked to inspire a new generation of Cuban Americans to reconnect with their heritage, family, and peers in Cuba. Over 4,000 young Cuban-Americans&nbsp; from across the country and all walks of life have applied to our program, which many have described as \u201clife-changing.\u201d We have seen our participants hug their grandparents for the first time, explore their heritage, develop friendships with Cuba\u2019s youth, and return to share these deeply moving experiences with loved ones and communities here in the United States.\nToday we are among the largest Cuban American organizations in the country. While much of our efforts would not be possible without the policy changes that began during your time in the Obama administration, our work transcends Washington\u2019s politics, administrations, and political parties. As the children and grandchildren of political prisoners, Pedro Pan refugees, Bay of Pigs veterans, and descendants of Marielitos, we understand the pain of exile and the importance of human rights.\nOne of the lasting legacies of the Obama presidency is the impact it had on a new generation of Cuban Americans and our peers on the island. During your campaign, you said that you would pursue a policy of advancing U.S. interests and empowering the Cuban people to freely determine their own future. In advance of your inauguration, we respectfully ask that you consider recommendations from young Cuban Americans, which represent the views of the majority of Americans, Cuban Americans, and Cubans on the island:\n\nA PRO-CUBAN FAMILY POLICY THAT PRIORITIZES&nbsp; HUMAN RIGHTS. The North Star of our country\u2019s Cuba policy should be advancing U.S. interests and the well-being of the Cuban people. To this end, we encourage you to pursue a pro-family policy of principled engagement. We also strongly support our U.S. diplomats working with their Cuban counterparts to address a variety of issues, including upholding America\u2019s longstanding commitment to human rights around the world.\nAFFIRM THE RIGHT OF CUBAN AMERICANS TO VISIT AND SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES. Under your previous administration, travel restrictions were broadly lifted, allowing Cuban Americans to travel freely to visit family on the island. President Trump\u2019s sharp reversal in this policy was counterproductive, cruel, and did nothing to improve human rights. We strongly urge you to reject these misguided recommendations and renew the successful travel policy implemented during the Obama administration.\nENCOURAGE U.S. TRAVELERS TO SUPPORT CUBA\u2019S PRIVATE SECTOR AND CIVIL SOCIETY. During your time as Vice-President, hundreds of thousands of Americans visited Cuba, fueling the fastest growth in its private sector since 1959. Rather than burdening Americans with government regulations that make it harder to visit the island, your Administration should encourage U.S. travelers to stay in Cuban family homes, support privately-owned small businesses, and go beyond the beaten tourist path. Cultural exchanges between the U.S. and Cuba were also effective at creating ties and understanding between Cuban Americans and Cubans alike. We would gladly work with you on developing such initiatives, as this is how we plan our visits to Cuba. Americans are the best ambassadors of our nation\u2019s values, and we should want more of our people engaging and supporting broader cross-sections of Cuban society. Kitchen table diplomacy works, and we should encourage it.\nRESUME DISCUSSIONS WITH CUBA. While Cuban families have already begun the process of reconciliation, there is still much work to be done. In 2015, Pope Francis called on the Cuban government and the Obama administration to \u201cset a global example of reconciliation.\u201d The process of reconciliation requires diligence, discussion, compromise, patience and commitment on all sides. Renewed talks and visible commitment to reconciliation is important for lasting support of your policies by Cuban Americans and Cubans alike.\nRESTORE THE EMBASSY IN HAVANA. As the dozens of young Cuban Americans who have visited their loved ones on the island through our program can attest, the U.S. Embassy is vital to American interests and has graciously hosted Cuban Americans, Cuban youth, activists, artists, entrepreneurs, and students. A restored consular presence is also necessary for reunifying Cuban American families with their relatives on the island through the U.S. immigration process and travel visas. We encourage your administration to expand staffing at the embassy while providing adequate safeguards for people working there.\nSUPPORT CUBA\u2019S ENTREPRENEURS, YOUTH, AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. Since 2009, Cuba\u2019s licensed private sector workforce has grown by over 300 percent, largely due to an infusion of remittances and visitors from the United States. We have been inspired by the Cuban entrepreneurs--particularly the youth--who work hard to offer better lives for their families. The expansion of wifi and mobile internet across the island has allowed for an increased flow of information, independent digital media outlets,&nbsp; and the creation of new business models that make use of 3G and 4G cell phone service. Your administration should support these efforts and the ability of U.S. technology companies to support the expansion of the internet in Cuba.\n\nCuba is responsible for deciding its fate, but we believe the United States can play a positive role through engagement. These recommendations are actionable, and reflect the views and values of the majority of the American people, Cuban Americans, and the 11 million Cubans on the island. Our efforts are continuing, and have continued even in the face of political challenges and headwinds. We continue to need&nbsp; advocates to voice and give support for engagement. We will always welcome an opportunity to discuss with you the importance of US-Cuba policy to our generation, our community, and our country.\nSincerely,\nCubaOne Foundation\nCarlos Lazo, Bridges of Love / Puentes de AmorCenter for Democracy in the AmericasCuba Educational TravelCuban American Narratives &amp; Dialogue for Equity, Liberation and Allyship (CANDELA)Cuban American Youth OrchestraEngage CubaInspire CubaLike a CubanMarisa Daniela (@mimaincuba)Other Oceans", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/5/fa/zx/HSfAzxXIAcspuQx-800x450-noPad.jpg?1608162646"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/alexia-henderson-workman-dress-code?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "J\u200b.\u200bH Workman\u2019s Problem with Dress Code Inequality", "description": "We want to change some of the dress code rules and make them more reasonable.

We have a right to an education and that shouldn\u2019t be taken for a silly article of clothing. Girls are most often reported for dress code violations. Not boys. I personally have worn a tank top and got a warning for getting dress coded if i didn\u2019t cover up. Wasn\u2019t spaghetti straps, but it was showing my shoulders. I\u2019ve seen boys wear tank tops quite often without being dress coded. It\u2019s disrespectful to girls. It\u2019s also unfair to our curvier girls. Girls on the thinner side often get away with almost everything when it comes to dress code and they are tired of it. Our school promotes and spreads the idea of self love inside and out, yet dress codes us based on our bodies. Something we cannot control. If the rules can\u2019t be changed, we at least ask of J.H Workman to be more fair with how they give out these violations and ISS slips.

At Tuesday's board meeting the board decided to use the CMAR method with influence from the contracted hired project manager from Phoenix. The CMAR delivery method is not priced competitively. This is the biggest CMAR project that Yuma would ever have. It's time that Yuma starts making decisions that benefit Yuma, not Maricopa. The YUHSD board has a rightful duty to be good stewards of our bond monies. They owe the taxpayers at least the work to do a competitive bid for the building of the Somerton High School. This would give the community the most bang for their buck. CMAR is the least bang for our buck.\n2 months ago, the city of Yuma saved 2 million dollars by using a competitive bid method instead of a CMAR method.&nbsp; The city of Somerton deserves a full competitive bidding process. Now is not the time to be \"lazy\" or trustful of one method, especially when the most qualified CMAR candidate basically gets the full $47 million to complete the project. With a full competitive bidding process, there is potential for the community to save millions. Please pay attention Yuma our community is about to be taken advantage of again by Maricopa.

Whenever a homicide takes place; three elements must always exist in that space of time. A victim, a suspect and a motive. Many times all three are known and the story gets told. However should any of the three be missing; wonder, speculation, and guesswork now create the narrative. But based on whose version of events though? Since no one else has come forward, here are the family's events based on the murder of a loved one.\nOn January 1, 2018 a cold New Years morning approximately 6:00 am Taiwon Montrea' Robinson a 23 year old African American man was found slain in the back of his mother home in Jersey City N.J where his mother's resident complex was under a 24 hour surveillance camera which captured the whole fatal killing! No motive or suspect(s) have yet to be established. With so much wonder, speculation and guesswork going on, the family is left to seek answers on their own. Oftentimes the motive to a homicide can be tied to the victims' lifestyle, but Taiwon Robinson did not live a typical lifestyle that would lead to him being murdered.\nAt 23 years of age Taiwon Robinson had just embarked on a merit-based job promotion to supervisor, where his dedication as a hard working employee at Rent The Runway was noticed for a promotion, while at the same time overtaking full custody of his beautiful 3 year old daughter Asiyaa Robinson. Taiwon Robinson was an excellent devoted father to his 3 year old daughter Asiyaa. Who frequently asks 'Is my daddy still with God' \"When is my daddy coming home\" His 3 year old daughter Asiyaa has been traumatized by this whole senseless act of crime ordeal. She also deserves answers!\nTo know Taiwon Robinson was to truly love him, he was quiet, friendly, respectful, family oriented and helpful in his community. The state lead detective Guershon Cherilien has supporting statements from his managers, co-workers, neighborhood, family and friends that also validates Taiwon character \"he would not hurt a fly\". Taiwon Robinson has NO gang ties or affiliations or NO arrest record, but was frequently harassed and racially profiled by police! But why?\nThe family is in disbelief as to why someone would want to hurt Taiwon Robinson. In mid 2017 mother of Taiwon Robinson launched two major investigations, after experiencing over ten years of harassment, targeting, discrimination, black-balling and defamation of character. During the mid 2017 investigations our family was receiving threatening phone calls from a white male ethnicity, well as being followed and stalked on numerous occasions.\nIn 2017 Taiwon Robinson grandfather property also caught a suspicious fire, until today the family still have not received any police or fire department reports indicating the cause of fire. But why? The New Year's morning of January 1, 2018 approximately 5:00-5:15 am Taiwon Robinson mother had just completed her early morning work shift when she heard a disturbance noise, after settling in. which is rare and outside of the normal in this Jersey City downtown location.\nI immediately said to myself that the disturbing sound did not sound like fireworks, which New Jersey or New York lit once the clock turned 12:00 am to bring in the New Year. I immediately got-up and went to the front door. I opened the door and I didn't hear or see anyone then I went to look out the back window and saw someone laying on the ground. I didn't see any blood so I wasn't sure if the person was shot. I immediately called 911 not even realizing it was my own child laying slain on the cold, icy ground!\nTaiwon Robinson had just celebrated New Years in New York City with close family members and two associated friends. Upon their return to Jersey City Taiwon was dropped off at his parked vehicle by his cousin. Taiwon then proceeded to Checkers' drive through restaurant on Communipaw Avenue Jersey City NJ before immediately dropping his two associated friends home then proceeded to his mother's house, where two suspects opened fire and returned to their vehicle which is also captured on camera. Were the suspects paid hired hit-men?\nAccording to the state investigators they stated that the suspects were waiting outside. The morning of January 1, 2018 was one of the coldest days in the year the temperature felt a least below 10 degrees. I can't even imagine someone waiting outside! The state homicide lieutenant did mention from the video footage that the impression on Taiwon's face was \"I can not wait to go inside and eat my checkers food\" he also indicated that Taiwon obeyed all traffic signs before parking and exiting his vehicle.\nWhat I recall from my recollection memory on January 1, 2018 from the second floor window I didn't see the first responding officers even check his pulse upon arrival. The releasing of the surveillance camera footage can clarify as one of the responding officers is arguing with a young lady who was coming in at the same time, while my son is laying in a pool of blood dying or dead! I didn't see any body movement from the victim (Taiwon) nor was his clothing removed upon arrival to check the victim (Taiwon) to see how they can further medically assist my son! The family would like to know was proper protocol procedures followed?\nThe family would like to know was Taiwon Robinson really dead on the scene, because of their negligence and did the police officers move a dead body from a homicide crime scene to say he was pronounced dead inside the hospital to cover themselves.? According to the funeral director examination Taiwon Robinson was not shot in the head and the bullet incision was a size of a penny. Which the lead detective verified, well as the Jersey City (EMS) emergency paramedics were also stationed one minute away (1 block), and the Jersey City Trauma Medical Center location was only two minutes away (2 blocks) from my home. What happened? Was my son a victim of a wrongful death? Or did the responding officers tamper with a homicide crime scene?\nAccording to the first responding police officers, which the officers do have two different contradicting statements on what actually occurred on January 1,2018 and the Jersey City Medical Center administrator emergency room front desk clerk had stated that Taiwion Robinson was in surgery upon arrival. As the family awaits approximately over 2 hours in the emergency room under the impression that Taiwon was in surgery, his grandmother called a Jersey City Medical Center employee family member to come and check on his progress to only find out that 23 year old Taiwon Robinson did not go to surgery and was laying in a pool of blood fully clothed on the scratcher the EMT worker rolled him in on!\nWhich is now raising family suspicion on what or who killed Taiwon Robinson? Was there any foul play involved!? Was Taiwon Robinson targeted for murder, or was he a random victim? Nothing from his past shows him creating a murderous enemy. The family has been receiving minimal feedback from investigators, and it seems like the investigation into this homicide has come to a complete halt. But why? Are there no more leads to go off of? But how? when there is a registered vehicle involved. The limited information that did come to surface, appears to have been suppressed. When the first two homicide detectives Aedan Stabile and Lashauna J. Swinney came to my home on January 1, 2018 for my 911 caller report and to tell me my son had died. Detective Swinney indicated I heard all about it. What did she hear about it?\nOn April 30, 2018 mother of Taiwon Robinson proceeded to the Medical Examiner Office at 325 Norfolk Street Newark NJ 07103 to retrieve a copy of Taiwon medical autopsy report to make sense on what happened to her son! Which mother of Taiwon have supporting documents of her visit case # 0918-0003 to only be told by the medical administrator clerk that I had to be a police officer to retrieve a copy! which is now raising more suspicion. What are they hiding!? Two years later into the state investigation the mother of 23 year old Taiwon Robinson still does not even know how her only son died or have a copy of his medical autopsy report to determine his death and that's only if the medical report was not falsified like the contradicting police report statements! Is this illegal?\nIs there a deeper issue surrounding this case that may be at play? When and what time was the homicide detective notified? Was the homicide detectives notified of his death before a death had been announced? Leads and suspects were overlooked and many requests and suggestions to investigators have been scanty carried out, or totally ignored. His determination of death is still not absolute. The police officers/medical examiner and funeral director differ where the bullet lies. None of this can be denied or confirmed, because authorities have been tight lipped and unresponsive with releasing any information to the family.\nThe prosecutor and lead detective both have differing opinions on what actually took place on January 1, 2018 with Taiwon Robinson murder case, which is more confusing. Taiwon Robinson personal belongings have not yet been turned over to the family. There has been no releasing of police reports. The lead detective mentioned that they have a suspect vehicle on camera. The owner of the vehicle was brought in for questioning, invoked their 5th amendment right, and has never been heard from again. How is this legal? How can your car be involved in a murder crime scene and your vehicle was not reported stolen then you walk away and never be seen again?\nMany of the information that is being withheld could still be crucial to solving the murder, yet the things that could lead us closer to a suspect and motive are lying dormant. Someone's efforts, or lack thereof has let the case go cold. Or was it all a part of their plan? The family feels: if local authorities are not putting forth the efforts to solve the murder case, then information should be released immediately to them, so that they can hire outside sources , and attempt to solve the crime on their own.\nIs it possible that someone is intentionally withholding information about the case to protect the true suspect and motive for this crime? We believe someone used their powers and privileges to manipulate the system by possibly destroying and withholding evidence and falsified documents. The great news is that Taiwon Robinson was approved for the victims of crime compensation which indicates that Taiwon was a victim claim # 98567.\nWhat we know about the case:\u2981 1. Taiwon Robinson was the victim.\u2981 2. Taiwon Robinson car was damaged and illegally confiscated and returned to the family over a Month on February 6, 2018 which his car was not a part of the crime scene. But why? If Taiwon Robinson was the victim.\u2981 3. Someone submitted a fake cover-up newspaper article that was not provided or confirmed by the homicide or prosecutors office surrounding the death.\u2981 4. The first responding police officers have contradicting statements on what actually occurred.\u2981 5. There's a strong possibility one of the responding officers was killed within the same week.\u2981 6. This is before the lead detective alleged there were accusations from the police of his involvement, which was over six months. The family has not heard back or was not notified when/or if a new detective was assigned to this case.\nThe family is desperately seeking justice. We are reaching out to you because we thought of you to be someone who may have leverage in reopening the investigation into this case. Do you have the desire to do so? Please say yes. There is a heart broken mother who stays awake at night seeking answers, a twin sister who lost half of her, and a baby girl who; due to this cruel act, will only know her dad through stories and pictures.\nWe will never fully find comfort. Answers to the heart wrenching questions of who, and why may ease some of our pain. Can you help? It may just be a man on man crime. Or perhaps a larger conspiracy is in play, and it is being passed on as just another inner-city street crime. We will never know unless some part/or any part of this story can be told. Was this a targeted hit, retaliation, negligence, wrongful death, orchestrated framework or a case of mistaken identity? What if this murder was staged, conspired and orchestrated by someone other than a common street criminal?\nThe public has NEVER been notified for their assistance in solving this case. I can not think of ANY unsolved homicide where the police doesn't release any plea to the public for assistance. NOTHING of this case has been extended to the public for help. Will you be able to help us get the information from authorities, so that it can be released to the public?\nThe family also needs the releasing of Taiwon Robinson personal belongings: (His Items are)\u2981 Cell Phone (I-phone) Taiwon could have recorded the incident prior to his death! and who was the last recorded call-log person he spoke to!\u2981 Jewelry- His gold chain!\u2981 Money in the amount of $400 dollars (with inventory sheet),Medical Examination, Police body cameras, Police reports, and the 24 hour surveillance camera video! Which is very dear to the family in helping solve Taiwon Robinson murder case.\nShortly, after Taiwon murder there is a strong possibility one of the responding officers was killed while off or on duty. We need his report ( A further look into his murder may surprise some as well). We are not saying they are connected, but it wouldn't surprise me though. If the murders are connected maybe the FBI should look further into these killings. Which the mother of Taiwon asked in the beginning of the investigation.\nNothing of Taiwon recent phone call-log/or social media activity shows him in disagreement with anyone according to the state lead detective Guershon Cherilien. Nothing of his past activity show him being a target for murder. Everything after his murder shows signs of mismanagement, or perhaps a cover-up. Please help the family find justice.\nThe family is desperately asking for public donations for his traumatized 5 year old daughter Asiyaa Robinson who frequently asks \"Is my daddy still with God\" Legal fees into launching a private independent investigation and a Independent Medical Autopsy Examination to determine his actual death, since the state medical autopsy examination has been in their possession for over two years.

In fact, I was compelled to join this project because I have lost loved ones to COVID-19, and it was disillusioning to observe the media, the government, and many people in the U.S. politicize a public health crisis.\nAdditionally, one of the most terrifying aspects of this pandemic is that we have very limited information about the long term effects of COVID-19, and there are hundreds of thousands of people dealing with long COVID. Almost 20 million people have contracted COVID-19 in the United States, and it's estimated that 10%-20% of them suffer from Long COVID. That's at least 2 million people.

We ask that the executive order instruct Pres. Biden economic team and Commerce Secretary, Gov. Gina Reimondo to create a plan designated to specifically eliminate past negative Credit history caused by Predatory Lending and Front Loaded Interest, reported by the three credit reporting agencies: Equifax; Experian; TransUnion; they are all publicly traded , for profit companies.\nAfrican Americans, American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) or once classified as Negroes, Coloreds, Black Indians of North America our communities have a challenge with not only everyday life but economics. They are the primary targets for predatory lenders and unusual lending practices. If we come togather one step at a time maybe, we can help some people in the long run.\nOur first step is to bar pre-calculated interest adjustment loans. Companies have created something called interest adjustment loans. This allows the companies to charge the entire amount of interest on the loans before the time accrue. They list principle and combined interest as account balance so there is no consideration of early payments. Second step is to expose the financial consequences of redlining and correct this institutional racism that is common practice that started in the segregation era and continue to this day.\nPredatory Lending and Front-Loading interest businesses specifically target minorities and allows the Racial Wealth Gap to continue to grow exponentially and create areas of bad credit communities. According to ADOS co- founder Antonio Moore, the average White middle-class Family has $120,000 in wealth and the average Black middle-class Family has $1,700. So if the White bread winner lose his job he has $120,000 to draw off while the Black Family has $1,700.\nBad credit makes it difficult to get a good paying job to getting a descent place to live. We have generational members of Boomers, Gen- X, Gen- Y, and Gen- Z with bad credit because of these Predatory Lending and Front-Loaded Industry. These companies will continue to be disrespectful and condescending to our Comunities.\nOne example of many is the practice of placing kill switches in cars. Some car dealerships will turn the car off if a customer is late on payment. Not only is this disrespectful but dangerous. Let us force them to complete in the free market and stop creating bad loans.\nIn the absence of true economic inclusion or policies specifically targeting the racial wealth gap, Predatory Loan Credit Amnesty For African Americans is a grassroot effort seeking a fresh start in the community.\nWill you join us in our efforts to bring financial Literacy and proper Legislation in our communities paving a way to reducing the wealth gap and inequality.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;", "image_url": "https://assets.change.org/photos/9/nm/wj/RkNmWjqBqJqHxRE-800x450-noPad.jpg?1610489134"}, {"url": "https://www.change.org/p/superintendent-austin-a-new-reopening-plan-for-pausd-secondary-schools-is-needed-when-santa-clara-county-moves-out-of-the-purple-tier?source_location=petitions_browse", "title": "A new reopening plan for PAUSD secondary schools", "description": "While we thank PAUSD leadership for their best efforts, we strongly believe that a new reopening plan for PAUSD secondary schools must be prepared and approved now.\nWe request a plan that:\n1) Guarantees continuity of education.
